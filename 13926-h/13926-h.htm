<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<br>
<p>A preface rather induces a man to speak of himself, which is
deemed the worst subject upon which he <i>can</i> speak. In history
we become acquainted with things, but in a preface with the author;
and, for a man to treat of himself, may be the most
<i>difficult</i> talk of the two: for in history, facts are
produced ready to the hand of the historian, which give birth to
thought, and it is easy to cloath that thought in words. But in a
preface, an author is obliged to forge from the brain, where he is
sometimes known to forge without fire. In one, he only reduces a
substance into form; but in the other, he must create that
substance.</p>
<p>As I am not an author by profession, it is no wonder if I am
unacquainted with the modes of authorship; but I apprehend, the
usual method of conducting the pen, is to polish up a founding
title-page, dignified with scraps of Latin, and then, to hammer up
a work to fit it, as nearly as genius, or want of genius, will
allow.</p>
<p>We next <i>turn over a new leaf</i>, and open upon a pompous
dedication, which answers many laudable purposes: if a coat of
arms, correctly engraven, should step first into view, we consider
it a singular advantage gained over a reader, like the first blow
in a combat. The dedication itself becomes a pair of stilts, which
advance an author something higher.</p>
<p>As a horse-shoe, nailed upon the threshold of a cottage,
prevents the influence of the witch; so a first-rate name, at the
head of a dedication, is a total bar against the critic; but this
great name, like a great officer, sometimes unfortunately stands at
the head of wretched troops.</p>
<p>When an author is too <i>heavy</i> to swim of himself, it serves
as a pair of bladders, to prevent his sinking.</p>
<p>It is farther productive of a <i>solid</i> advantage, that of a
present from the patron, more valuable than that from the
bookseller, which prevents his sinking under the pressure of
famine.</p>
<p>But, being wholly unknown to the great names of literary
consequence, I shall not attempt a dedication, therefore must lose
the benefit of the stilt, the bladder, and the horse-shoe.</p>
<p>Were I to enter upon a dedication, I should certainly address
myself, "<i>To the Inhabitants of Birmingham</i>." For to them I
not only owe much, but all; and I think, among that congregated
mass, there is not one person to whom I wish ill. I have the
pleasure of calling many of those inhabitants <i>Friends</i>, and
some of them share my warm affections equally with myself.
Birmingham, like a compassionate nurse, not only draws our persons,
but our esteem, from the place of our nativity, and fixes it upon
herself: I might add, <i>I was hungry, and she fed me</i>;
<i>thirsty, and she gave me drink</i>; <i>a stranger, and she took
me in</i>. I approached her with reluctance, because I did not know
her; I shall leave her with reluctance, because I do.</p>
<p>Whether it is perfectly confident in an author, to solicit the
indulgence of the public, though it may stand first in his wishes,
admits a doubt; for, if his productions will not bear the light, it
may be said, why does he publish? but, if they will, there is no
need to ask a favor; the world receives one from him. Will not a
piece everlastingly be tried by its merit? Shall we esteem it the
higher, because it was written at the age of thirteen? because it
was the effort of a week? delivered extempore? hatched while the
author stood upon one leg? or cobbled, while he cobbled a shoe? or
will it be a recommendation, that it issues forth in gilt binding?
The judicious world will not be deceived by the tinselled purse,
but will examine whether the <i>contents</i> are sterling.</p>
<p>Will it augment the value of this history, or cover its
blunders, to say, that I have never seen <i>Oxford?</i> That the
thick fogs of penury, prevented the sun of science from beaming
upon the mind? That necessity obliged me to lay down the
battledore, before I was master of the letters? And that, instead
of handling systems of knowledge, my hands, at the early period of
seven, became callous with labour?</p>
<p>But, though a whole group of pretences will have no effect with
the impartial eye, yet one reason pleads strongly in my favor--no
such thing ever appeared as <i>An History of Birmingham</i>. It is
remarkable, that one of the most singular places in the universe is
without an historian: that she never manufactured an history of
herself, who has manufactured almost every thing else; that so many
ages should elapse, and not one among her numerous sons of
industry, snatch the manners of the day from oblivion, group them
in design, with the touches of his pen, and exhibit the picture to
posterity. If such a production had ever seen the light, mine most
certainly would never have been written; a temporary bridge
therefore may satisfy the impatient traveller, till a more skilful
architect shall accommodate him with a complete production of
elegance, of use, and of duration.--Although works of genius ought
to come out of the mint doubly refined, yet history admits of a
much greater latitude to the author. The best upon the subject,
though defective, may meet with regard.</p>
<p>It has long been a complaint, that local history is much wanted.
This will appear obvious, if we examine the places we know, with
the histories that treat of them. Many an author has become a
cripple, by historically travelling through <i>all England</i>, who
might have made a tolerable figure, had he staid at home. The
subject is too copious for one performance, or even the life of one
man. The design of history is knowledge: but, if simply to tell a
tale, be all the duty of an historian, he has no irksome task
before him; for there is nothing more easy than to relate a fact;
but, perhaps, nothing more difficult than to relate it well.</p>
<p>The situation of an author is rather precarious--if the smiles
of the world chance to meet his labours, he is apt to forget
himself; if otherwise, he is soon forgot. The efforts of the critic
may be necessary to clip the wings of a presuming author, lest his
rising vanity becomes insupportable: but I pity the man, who writes
a book which none will peruse a second time; critical exertions are
not necessary to pull him down, he will fall of himself. The sin of
writing carries its own punishment, the tumultuous passions of
anxiety and expectation, like the jarring elements in October,
disturb his repose, and, like them, are followed by stirility: his
cold productions, injured by no hand but that of time, are found
sleeping on the shelf unmolested. It is easy to describe his fears
before publication, but who can tell his feelings after judgment is
passed upon his works? His only consolation is accusing the critic
of injustice, and thinking the world in the wrong. But if
repentence should not follow the culprit, hardened in scribbling,
it follows, his bookseller, oppressed with <i>dead works</i>.
However, if all the evils in Pandora's box are emptied on a blasted
author, this one comfort remains behind--The keeper of a
circulating library, or the steward of a reading society can tell
him, "His book is more <i>durable</i> than the others."</p>
<p>Having, many years ago, entertained an idea of this undertaking,
I made some trifling preparations; but, in 1775, a circumstance of
a private nature occurring, which engaged my attention for several
years, I relinquished the design, destroyed the materials, and
meant to give up the thought for ever. But the intention revived in
1780, and the work followed.</p>
<p>I may be accused of quitting the regular trammels of history,
and sporting in the fields of remark: but, although our habitation
justly stands first in our esteem, in return for rest, content, and
protection; does it follow that we should never stray from it? If I
happen to veer a moment from the polar point of Birmingham, I shall
certainly vibrate again to the center. Every author has a manner
peculiar to himself, nor can he well forsake it. I should be
exceedingly hurt to omit a necessary part of intelligence, but
more, to offend a reader.</p>
<p>If GRANDEUR should censure me for sometimes recording the men of
mean life, let me ask, <i>Which is preferable</i>, he who thunders
at the anvil, or in the senate? The man who earnestly wishes the
significant letters, ESQ. spliced to the end of his name, will
despise the question; but the philosopher will answer, "They are
equal."</p>
<p>Lucrative views have no part in this production: I cannot
solicit a kind people to grant what they have already granted; but
if another finds that pleasure in reading, which I have done in
writing, I am paid.</p>
<p>As no history is extant, to inform me of this famous nursery of
the arts, perfection in mine must not be expected. Though I have
endeavoured to pursue the road to truth; yet, having no light to
guide, or hand to direct me, it is no wonder if I mistake it: but
we do not <i>condemn</i>, so much as <i>pity</i> the man for losing
his way, who first travels an unbeaten road.</p>
<p>Birmingham, for want of the recording hand, may be said to live
but one generation; the transactions of the last age, die in this;
memory is the sole historian, which being defective, I embalm the
present generation, for the inspection of the future.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to attempt a general character, for if the
attentive reader is himself of Birmingham, he is equally apprized
of that character; and, if a stranger, he will find a variety of
touches scattered through the piece, which, taken in a collective
view, form a picture of that generous people, who <i>merit his</i>
esteem, and <i>possess mine</i>.</p>

<h3>AN</h3>
<h2>HISTORY &amp;c.</h2>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p><i>Some account of the derivation of the name of
Birmingham</i>.</p>
<p>The word Birmingham, is too remote for certain explanation.
During the last four centuries it has been variously written
<i>Brumwycheham, Bermyngeham, Bromwycham, Burmyngham, Bermyngham,
Byrmyngham</i>, and <i>Birmingham</i>; nay, even so late as the
seventeenth century it was written <i>Bromicham</i>. Dugdale
supposes the name to have been given by the planter, or owner, in
the time of the Saxons; but, I suppose it much older than any
Saxon, date: besides, it is not so common for a man to give a name
to, as to take one from, a place. A man seldom gives his name
except he is the founder, as Petersburg from Peter the Great.</p>
<p>Towns, as well as every thing in nature, have exceedingly minute
beginnings, and generally take a name from situation, or local
circumstances. Would the Lord of a manor think it an honour to give
his name to two or three miserable huts? But, if in a succession of
ages these huts swell into opulence, they confer upon the lord an
honour, a residence, and a name. The terminations of <i>sted</i>,
<i>ham</i>, and <i>hurst</i>, are evidently Saxon, and mean the
same thing, a home.</p>
<p>The word, in later ages reduced to a certainty, hath undergone
various mutations; but the original seems to have been
<i>Bromwych</i>; <i>Brom</i> perhaps, from broom a shrub, for the
growth of which the soil is extremely favourable; <i>Wych</i>, a
descent, this exactly corresponds with the declivity from the High
Street to Digbeth. Two other places also in the neigbourhood bear
the same name, which serves to strengthen the opinion.</p>
<p>This infant colony, for many centuries after the first buddings
of existence, perhaps, had no other appellation than that of
Bromwych. Its center, for many reasons that might be urged, was the
Old Cross, and its increase, in those early ages of time must have
been very small.</p>
<p>A series of prosperity attending it, its lord might assume its
name, reside in it, and the particle <i>ham</i> would naturally
follow. This very probably happened under the Saxon Heptarchy, and
the name was no other than <i>Bromwycham</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="SITUATION."></a>SITUATION.</h2>
<br>
<p>It lies near the centre of the kingdom, in the north-west
extremity of the county of Warwick, in a kind of peninsula, the
northern part of which is bounded by Handsworth, in the county of
Stafford, and the southern by King's-norton, in the county of
Worcester; it is also in the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, and
in the deanery of Arden.</p>
<p>Let us perambulate the parish from the bottom of Digbeth, thirty
yards north of the bridge. We will proceed south-west up the bed of
the river, with Deritend, in the parish of Aston, on our left.
Before we come to the Floodgates, near Vaughton's Hole, we pass by
the Longmores, a small part of King's-norton. Crossing the river
Rea, we enter the vestiges of a small rivulet, yet visible, though
the stream hath been turned, perhaps, a thousand years, to supply
the moat. We now bear rather west, nearly in a straight line for
three miles, to Shirland brook, with Edgbaston on the left. At the
top of the first meadow from the river Rea, we meet the little
stream above-mentioned, in the pursuit of which, we cross the
Bromsgrove road a little east of the first mile stone. Leaving
Banner's marlpit to the left, we proceed up a narrow lane crossing
the old Bromsgrove road, and up to the turnpike at the five ways in
the road to Hales Owen. Leaving this road also to the left we
proceed down the lane towards Ladywood, cross the Icknield street,
a stone's cast east of the observatory, to the north extremity of
Rotton Park. We now meet with Shirland Brook, which leads us east,
and across the Dudley road, at the seven mile stone, having
Smethwick in the county of Stafford, on the left, down to Pigmill.
We now leave Handsworth on the left, following the stream through
Hockley great pool; cross the Wolverhampton road, and the
Ikenield-street at the same time down to Aston furnace, with that
parish on the left. At the bottom of Walmer-lane we leave the
water, move over the fields, nearly in a line to the post by the
Peacock upon Gosty-green. We now cross the Lichfield road, down
Duke-street, then the Coleshill road at the A B house. From thence
down the meadows, to Cooper's mill; up the river to the foot of
Deritend bridge; and then turn sharp to the right, keeping the
course of a drain in the form of a sickle, through John a Dean's
hole, into Digbeth, from whence we set out. In marching along
Duke-street, we leave about seventy houses to the left, and up the
river Rea, about four hundred more in Deritend, reputed part of
Birmingham, though not in the parish.</p>
<p>This little journey, nearly of an oval form, is about seven
miles. The longest diameter from Shirland brook to Deritend bridge
is about three, and the widest, from the bottom of Walmer Lane to
the rivulet, near the mile-stone, upon the Bromsgrove road, more
than two.</p>
<p>The superficial contents of the parish may be upwards of four
miles, about three thousand acres.</p>
<p>Birmingham is by much the smallest parish in the neighbourhood,
those of Aston and Sutton are each about five times as large,
Yardley four, and King's-Norton eight.</p>
<p>When Alfred, that great master of legislation, parished out his
kingdom, or rather, put the finishing hand to that important work;
where he met with a town, he allotted a smaller quantity of land,
because the inhabitants chiefly depended upon commerce; but where
there was only a village, he allotted a larger, because they
depended upon agriculture.</p>
<p>This observation goes far in proving the antiquity of the place,
for it is nine hundred years since this division took effect.</p>
<p>The buildings occupy the south east part of the parish; perhaps,
with their appendages, about six hundred acres.</p>
<p>This south east part, being insufficient for the extraordinary
increase of the inhabitants, she has of late extended her buildings
along the Bromsgrove road, near the boundaries of Edgbaston; and
actually on the other side planted three of her streets in the
parish of Aston. Could the sagacious Alfred have seen into
futurity, he would have augmented her borders.</p>
<p>As no part of the town lies flat, the showers promote both
cleanliness and health, by removing obstructions.</p>
<p>The approach is on every side by ascent, except that from
Hales-Owen, north west, which gives a free access of air, even to
the most secret recesses of habitation.</p>
<p>Thus eminently situated, the sun can exercise his full powers of
exhalation.</p>
<p>The foundation upon which this mistress of the arts is erected,
is one solid mass of dry reddish sand.</p>
<p>The vapours that rise from the earth are the great promoters of
disease; but here, instead of the moisture ascending to the
prejudice of the inhabitant, the contrary is evident; for the water
descends through the pores of the sand, so that even our very
cellars are habitable.</p>
<p>This accounts for the almost total extinction of the ague among
us:--During a residence of thirty years, I have never seen one
person afflicted with it, though, by the opportunities of office, I
have frequently visited the repositories of the sick.</p>
<p>Thus peculiarly favoured, this happy spot, enjoys four of the
greatest benefits that can attend human existence--water, air, the
fun, and a situation free from damps.</p>
<p>All the <i>past</i> writers upon Birmingham have viewed her as
low and watery, and with reason; because Digbeth, then the chief
street, bears that description. But all the future writers will
view her on an eminence, and with as much reason; because, for one
low street, we have now fifty elevated.</p>
<p>Birmingham, like the empire to which she belongs, has been, for
many centuries, travelling <i>up hill</i>; and, like that, rising
in consequence.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="SOIL."></a>SOIL.</h2>
<br>
<p>The soil is rather light, sandy, and weak; and though metals, of
various sorts, are found in great plenty, <i>above</i> the surface,
we know of nothing below, except sand and gravel, stone and water.
All the riches of the place, like those of an empiric, in laced
cloaths, appear on the <i>outside</i>.</p>
<p>The northern part of the parish, for about four hundred acres,
to the disgrace of the age, is yet a shameful waste.</p>
<p>A small part of the land near the town, is parcelled out into
little gardens, at ten or twenty shillings each, amounting to about
sixteen pounds per acre.</p>
<p>These are not intended so much for profit, as health and
amusement.</p>
<p>Others are let in detached pieces for private use, at about four
pounds per acre. So that this small parish cannot boast of more
than six or eight farms, and these of the smaller size, at about
two pounds per acre. Manure from the sty brings about 16s. per
waggon load, that from the stable about 12, and that from the fire
and the street, five.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="WATER."></a>WATER.</h2>
<br>
<p>I think there is not any natural river runs through the parish,
but there are three that mark the boundaries of it, for about half
its circumference, described above; none of these supply family
use. After penetrating into a body of sand, interspersed with a
small strata of soft Rock, and sometimes of gravel; at the depth of
about twenty yards, we come to plenty of water, rather hard. There
are in the lower parts of the town, two excellent springs of soft
water, suitable for most purposes; one at the top of Digbeth, the
other, Lady-Well. Or rather, one spring, or bed of water, with many
out-lets, continuing its course along the bottom of the hill,
parallel with Small-brook-street, Edgbaston street, St.
Martin's-lane, and Park-street; sufficiently copious to supply the
whole city of London. Water is of the first consequence, it often
influences disease, always the habit of body: that of Birmingham is
in general productive of salutary effects.</p>
<p>That dreadful disorder, the stone, is seldom found among us. I
can recollect but very few, in my time, under this severe
complaint, which is perhaps owing to that valuable element. I
mentioned this remark to an eminent surgeon, who assured me, that,
in his long course of practice, he had never been concerned in one
operation in that unhappy disorder.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="BATHS."></a>BATHS.</h2>
<br>
<p>At Lady-Well, are the most complete baths in the whole Island.
There are seven in number; erected at the expence of 2000<i>l</i>.
Accommodation is ever ready for hot or cold bathing; for immersion
or amusement; with conveniency for sweating. That, appropriated for
swimming, is eighteen Yards by thirty-six, situated in the centre
of a garden, in which are twenty four private undressing-houses,
the whole surrounded by a wall 10 feet high. Pleasure and health
are the guardians of the place. The gloomy horrors of a bath,
sometimes deter us from its use, particularly, if aided by
complaint; but the appearance of these is rather inviting. We read
of painted sepulchres, whose <i>outsides</i> are richly ornamented,
but <i>within</i> are full of corruption and death. The reverse is
before us. No elegance appears without, but within are the Springs
of life! The expence was great, the utility greater.</p>
<p>I do not know any author, who has reckoned man among the
amphibious race of animals, neither do I know any animal who better
deserves it. Man is lord of the little ball on which he treads, one
half of which, at least, is water. If we do not allow him to be
amphibious, we deprive him of half his sovereignty. He justly bears
that name, who can <i>live</i> in the water. Many of the disorders
incident to the human frame are prevented, and others cured, both
by fresh and salt bathing; so that we may properly remark, "<i>He
lives in the water</i>, who can find life, nay, even <i>health</i>
in that friendly element."</p>
<p>The greatest treasure on earth is health; but, a treasure, of
all others, the least valued by the owner. Other property is best
rated when in possession, but this, can only be rated when lost. We
sometimes observe a man, who, having lost this inestimable jewel,
seeks it with an ardour equal to its worth; but when every research
by land, is eluded, he fortunately finds it in the water. Like the
fish, he pines away upon shore, but like that, recovers again in
the deep.</p>
<p>Perhaps Venus is represented as rising from the ocean, which is
no other then a bath of the larger size, to denote, that bathing is
the refiner of health, consequently, of beauty; and Neptune being
figured in advanced life, indicates, that it is a preservative to
old age.</p>
<p>The cure of disease among the Romans, by bathing, is supported
by many authorities; among others, by the number of baths
frequently discovered, in which, pleasure, in that warm climate,
bore a part. But this practice seemed to decline with Roman
freedom, and never after held the eminence it deserved. Can we
suppose, the physician stept between disease and the bath, to
hinder their junction; or, that he lawfully holds, by prescription,
the tenure of sickness, in <i>fee</i>?</p>
<p>The knowledge of this singular <i>art of healing</i>, is at
present only in infancy. How far it may prevent, or conquer
disease; to what measure it may be applied, in particular cases,
and the degrees of use, in different constitutions, are enquiries
that will be better understood by a future generation.</p>
<br>

<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="AIR."></a>AIR.</h2>
<br>
<p>As we have passed through the water, let us now investigate her
sister fluid, the air. They are both necessary to life, and the
purity of both to the prolongation of it; this small difference
lies between them, a man may live a day without water, but not an
hour without air: If a man wants better water, it may be removed
from a distant place for his benefit; but if he wants air, he must
remove himself.--The natural air of Birmingham, perhaps, cannot be
excelled in this climate, the moderate elevation and dry soil
evinces this truth; but it receives an alloy from the congregated
body of fifty thousand people; also from the smoke of an
extraordinary number of fires used in business; and perhaps, more
from the various effluvia arising from particular trades. It is not
uncommon to see a man with green hair or a yellow wig, from his
constant employment in brass; if he reads, the green vestiges of
his occupation remain on every leaf, never to be expunged. The
inside of his body, no doubt, receives the same tincture, but is
kept clean by being often washed with ale. Some of the fair sex,
likewise are subject to the same inconvenience, but find relief in
the same remedy.</p>

<h2><a name="LONGEVITY."></a>LONGEVITY.</h2>
<br>
<p>Man is a time-piece. He measures out a certain space, then stops
for ever. We see him move upon the earth, hear him click, and
perceive in his face the uses of intelligence. His external
appearance will inform us whether he is old-fashioned, in which
case, he is less valuable upon every gambling calculation. His face
also will generally inform us whether all is right within. This
curious machine is filled with a complication of movements, very
unfit to be regulated by the rough hand of ignorance, which
sometimes leaves a mark not to be obliterated even by the hand of
an artist. If the works are directed by violence, destruction is
not far off. If we load it with the oil of luxury, it will give an
additional vigor, but in the end, clog and impede the motion. But
if the machine is under the influence of prudence, she will guide
it with an even, and a delicate hand, and perhaps the piece may
move on 'till it is fairly worn out by a long course of fourscore
years.</p>
<p>There are a set of people who expect to find that health in
medicine, which possibly might be found in regimen, in air,
exercise, or serenity of mind.</p>
<p>There is another class amongst us, and that rather numerous,
whose employment is laborious, and whose conduct is irregular.
Their time is divided between hard working, and hard drinking, and
both by a fire. It is no uncommon thing to see one of these, at
forty, wear the aspect of sixty, and finish a life of violence at
fifty, which the hand of prudence would have directed to
eighty.</p>
<p>The strength of a kingdom consists in the multitude of its
inhabitants; success in trade depends upon the manufacturer; the
support and direction of a family, upon the head of it. When this
useful part of mankind, therefore, are cut off in the active part
of life, the community sustains a loss, whether we take the matter
in a national, a commercial, or a private view.</p>
<p>We have a third class, who shun the rock upon which these last
fall, but wreck upon another; they run upon scylla though they have
missed charybdis; they escape the liquid destruction, but split
upon the solid. These are proficients in good eating; adepts in
culling of delicacies, and the modes of dressing them. Matters of
the whole art of cookery; each carries a kitchen in his head. Thus
an excellent constitution may be stabbed by the spit. Nature never
designed us to live well, and continue well; the stomach is too
weak a vessel to be richly and deeply laden. Perhaps more injury is
done by eating than by drinking; one is a secret, the other an open
enemy: the secret is always supposed the most dangerous. Drinking
attacks by assault, but eating by sap: luxury is seldom visited by
old age. The best antidote yet discovered against this kind of slow
poison is exercise; but the advantages of elevation, air, and
water, on one hand, and disadvantages of crowd, smoke, and effluvia
on the other, are trifles compared to intemperance.</p>
<p>We have a fourth class, and with these I shall shut up the
clock. If this valuable machine comes finished from the hand of
nature; if the rough blasts of fortune only attack the outward
case, without affecting the internal works, and if reason conduces
the piece, it may move on, with a calm, steady, and uninterrupted
pace to a great extent of years, 'till time only annihilates the
motion.</p>
<p>I personally know amongst us a Mrs. Dallaway, aged near 90;
George Davis, 85; John Baddally, Esq; and his two brothers, all
between 80 and and 90; Mrs. Allen, 92; Mrs. Silk, 84; John Burbury,
84; Thomas Rutter, 88; Elizabeth Bentley, 88; John Harrison and his
wife, one 86, the other 88; Mrs. Floyd, 87; Elizabeth Simms, 88;
Sarah Aston, 98; Isaac Spooner, Esq; 89; Joseph Scott, Esq; 94; all
at this day, January 9, 1780, I believe enjoy health and capacity.
This is not designed as a complete list of the aged, but of such
only as immediately occur to memory. I also knew a John England who
died at the age of 89; Hugh Vincent, 94; John Pitt, 100; George
Bridgens, 103; Mrs. More, 104. An old fellow assured me he had kept
the market 77 years: he kept it for several years after to my
knowledge. At 90 he was attacked by an acute disorder, but,
fortunately for himself, being too poor to purchase medical
assistance, he was left to the care of nature, who opened that door
to health which the physician would have locked for ever. At 106 I
heard him swear with all the fervency of a recruit: at 107 he died.
It is easy to give instances of people who have breathed the smoak
of Birmingham for threescore years, and yet have scarcely left the
precincts of of youth. Such are the happy effects of constitution,
temper, and conduct!</p>

<h2><i><a name="Ancient_State_of_Birmingham"></a>Ancient State of
Birmingham</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p>We have now to pass through the very remote ages of time,
without staff to support us, without light to conduct us, or hand
to guide us. The way is long, dark, and slippery. The credit of an
historian is built upon truth; he cannot assert, without giving his
facts; he cannot surmise, without giving his reasons; he must
relate things as they are, not as he would have them. The fabric
founded in error will moulder of itself, but that founded in
reality will stand the age and the critic.</p>
<p>Except half a dozen pages in Dugdale, I know of no author who
hath professedly treated of Birmingham. None of the histories which
I have seen bestow upon it more than a few lines, in which we are
sure to be treated with the noise of hammers and anvils; as if the
historian thought us a race of dealers in thunder, lightning, and
wind; or infernals, puffing in blast and smoak.</p>
<p>Suffer me to transcribe a passage from Leland, one of our most
celebrated writers, employed by Henry the VIIIth to form an
itinerary of Britain, whose works have stood the test of 250 years.
We shall observe how much he erred for want of information, and how
natural for his successors to copy him.</p>
<p>"I came through a pretty street as ever I entered, into
Birmingham town. This street, as I remember, is called Dirtey
(Deritend). In it dwells smithes and cutlers, and there is a brook
that divides this street from Birmingham, an hamlet, or member,
belonging to the parish therebye.</p>
<p>"There is at the end of Dirtey a propper chappel and
mansion-house of timber, (the moat) hard on the ripe, as the brook
runneth down; and as I went through the ford, by the bridge, the
water came down on the right hand, and a few miles below goeth into
Tame. This brook, above Dirtey, breaketh in two arms, that a little
beneath the bridge close again. This brook riseth, as some say,
four or five miles above Birmingham, towards Black-hills.</p>
<p>"The beauty of Birmingham, a good market-town in the extreme
parts of Warwickshire, is one street going up alonge, almost from
the left ripe of the brook, up a meane hill, by the length of a
quarter of a mile, I saw but one parish-church in the town.</p>
<p>"There be many smithes in the town that use to make knives and
all manner of cutting tools, and many loriners that make bittes,
and a great many naylers; so that a great part of the town is
maintained by smithes, who have their iron and sea-coal out of
Staffordshire."</p>
<p>Here we find some intelligence, and more mistake, cloathed in
the dress of antique diction, which plainly evinces the necessity
of modern history.</p>
<p>It is matter of surprise that none of those religious drones,
the monks, who hived in the priory for fifteen or twenty
generations, ever thought of indulging posterity with an history of
Birmingham. They could not want opportunity, for they lived a life
of indolence; nor materials, for they were nearer the infancy of
time, and were possessed of historical fads now totally lost.
Besides, nearly all the little learning in the kingdom was
possessed by this class of people; and the place, in their day,
must have enjoyed an eminent degree of prosperity.</p>
<p>Though the town has a modern appearance, there is reason to
believe it of great antiquity; my Birmingham reader, therefore,
must suffer me to carry him back into the remote ages of the
Ancient Britons to visit his fable ancestors.</p>
<p>We have no histories of those times but what are left by the
Romans, and these we ought to read with caution, because they were
parties in the dispute. If two antagonists write each his own
history, the discerning reader will sometimes draw the line of
justice between them; but where there is only one, partiality is
expected. The Romans were obliged to make the Britons war-like, or
there would have been no merit in conquering them: they must also
sound forth their ignorance, or there would have been none in
improving them. If the Britons were that wretched people they are
represented by the Romans, they could not be worth conquering: no
man subdues a people to improve them, but to profit by them. Though
the Romans at that time were in their meridian of splendor, they
pursued Britain a whole century before they reduced it; which
indicates that they considered it as a valuable prize. Though the
Britons were not masters of science, like the Romans; though the
fine arts did not flourish here, as in Rome, because never planted;
yet by many testimonies it is evident they were masters of plain
life; that many of the simple arts were practiced in that day, as
well as in this; that assemblages of people composed cities, the
same as now, but in an inferior degree; and that the country was
populous is plain from the immense army Boadicia brought into the
field, except the Romans increased that army that their merit might
be greater in defeating it. Nay, I believe we may with propriety
carry them beyond plain life, and charge them with a degree of
elegance: the Romans themselves allow the Britons were complete
masters of the chariot; that when the scythe was fixed at each end
of the axle-tree, they drove with great dexterity into the midst of
the enemy, broke their ranks, and mowed them down. The chariot,
therefore, could not be made altogether for war, but, when the
scythes were removed, it still remained an emblem of pride, became
useful in peace, was a badge of high-life, and continues so with
their descendants to this day.</p>
<p>We know the instruments of war used by the Britons were a sword,
spear, shield and scythe. If they were not the manufacturers, how
came they by these instruments? We cannot allow either they or the
chariots were imported, because that will give them a much greater
consequence: they must also have been well acquainted with the
tools used in husbandry, for they were masters of the field in a
double sense. Bad also as their houses were, a chest of carpentry
tools would be necessary to complete them. We cannot doubt,
therefore, from these evidences, and others which might be adduced,
that the Britons understood the manufactory of iron. Perhaps
history cannot produce an instance of any place in an improving
country, like England, where the coarse manufactory of iron has
been carried on, that ever that laborious art went to decay, except
the materials failed; and as we know of no place where such
materials have failed, there is the utmost reason to believe our
fore-fathers, the Britons, were supplied with those necessary
implements by the black artists of the Birmingham forge. Iron-stone
and coal are the materials for this production, both which are
found in the neighbourhood in great plenty. I asked a gentleman of
knowledge, if there was a probability of the delphs failing? He
answered, "Not in five thousand years."</p>
<p>The two following circumstances strongly evince this ancient
British manufactory:--</p>
<p>Upon the borders of the parish stands Aston-furnace,
appropriated for melting ironstone, and reducing it into pigs: this
has the appearance of great antiquity. From the melted ore, in this
subterranean region of infernal aspect, is produced a calx, or
cinder, of which there is an enormous mountain. From an attentive
survey, the observer would suppose so prodigious a heap could not
accumulate in one hundred generations; however, it shows no
perceptible addition in the age of man.</p>
<p>There is also a common of vast extent, called
Wednesbury-old-field, in which are the vestiges of many hundreds of
coal-pits, long in disuse, which the curious antiquarian would deem
as long in sinking, as the mountain of cinders in rising.</p>
<p>The minute sprig of Birmingham, no doubt first took root in this
black soil, which, in a succession of ages, hath grown to its
present opulence. At what time this prosperous plant was set, is
very uncertain; perhaps as long before the days of Caesar as it is
since. Thus the mines of Wednesbury empty their riches into the lap
of Birmingham, and thus she draws nurture from the bowels of the
earth.</p>
<p>The chief, if not the only manufactory of Birmingham, from its
first existence to the restoration of Charles the Second, was in
iron: of this was produced instruments of war and of husbandry,
furniture for the kitchen, and tools for the whole system of
carpentry.</p>
<p>The places where our athletic ancestors performed these curious
productions of art, were in the shops fronting the street: some
small remains of this very ancient custom are yet visible, chiefly
in Digbeth, where about a dozen shops still exhibit the original
music of anvil and hammer.</p>
<p>As there is the highest probability that Birmingham produced her
manufactures long before the landing of Caesar, it would give
pleasure to the curious enquirer, could he be informed of her size
in those very early ages; but this information is for ever hid from
the historian, and the reader. Perhaps there never was a period in
which she saw a decline, but that her progress has been certain,
though slow, during the long space of two or three thousand years
before Charles the Second.</p>
<p>The very roads that proceed from Birmingham, are also additional
indications of her great antiquity and commercial influence.</p>
<p>Where any of these roads lead up an eminence, they were worn by
the long practice of ages into deep holloways, some of them twelve
or fourteen yards below the surface of the banks, with which they
were once even, and so narrow as to admit only one passenger.</p>
<p>Though modern industry, assisted by various turnpike acts, has
widened the upper part and filled up the lower, yet they were all
visible in the days of our fathers, and are traceable even in ours.
Some of these, no doubt, were formed by the spade, to soften the
fatigue of climbing the hill, but many were owing to the pure
efforts of time, the horse, and the showers. As inland trade was
small, prior to the fifteenth century, the use of the wagon, that
great destroyer of the road, was but little known. The horse was
the chief conveyor of burthen among the Britons, and for centuries
after: if we, therefore, consider the great length of time it would
take for the rains to form these deep ravages, we must place the
origin of Birmingham, at a very early date.</p>
<p>One of these subterranean passages, in part filled up, will
convey its name to posterity in that of a street, called
Holloway-head, 'till lately the way to Bromsgrove and to Bewdley,
but not now the chief road to either. Dale-end, once a deep road,
has the same derivation. Another at Summer-hill, in the Dudley
road, altered in 1753. A remarkable one is also between the
Salutation and the Turnpike, in the Wolverhampton road. A fifth at
the top of Walmer-lane, changed into its present form in 1764.
Another between Gosta-green and Aston-brook, reduced in 1752.</p>
<p>All the way from Dale-end to Duddeston, of which
Coleshill-street now makes a part, was sunk five or six feet,
though nearly upon a flat, 'till filled up in 1756 by act of
Parliament: but the most singular is that between Deritend and
Camp-hill, in the way to Stratford, which is, even now, many yards
below the banks; yet the seniors of the last age took a pleasure in
telling us, they could remember when it would have buried a wagon
load of hay beneath its present surface.</p>
<p>Thus the traveller of old, who came to purchase the produce of
Birmingham, or to sell his own, seemed to approach her by sap.</p>
<p>British traces are, no doubt, discoverable in the old
Dudley-road, down Easy-hill, under the canal; at the eight
mile-stone, and at Smethwick: also in many of the private roads
near Birmingham, which were never thought to merit a repair,
particularly at Good-knaves-end, towards Harborne; the Green-lane,
leading to the Garrison; and that beyond Long-bridge, in the road
to Yardley; all of them deep holloways, which carry evident tokens
of antiquity. Let the curious calculator determine what an amazing
length of time would elapse in wearing the deep roads along
Saltleyfield, Shaw-hill, Allum-rock, and the remainder of the way
to Stichford, only a pitiful hamlet of a dozen houses.</p>
<p>The ancient centre of Birmingham seems to have been the Old
Cross, from the number of streets pointing towards it. Wherever the
narrow end of a street enters a great thorough-fare, it indicates
antiquity, this is the case with Philip-street, Bell-street,
Spiceal-street, Park-street, and Moor-street, which not only
incline to the centre above-mentioned, but all terminate with their
narrow ends into the grand passage. These streets are narrow at the
entrance, and widen as you proceed: the narrow ends were formed
with the main street at first, and were not, at that time, intended
for streets themselves. As the town increased, other blunders of
the same kind were committed, witness the gateway late at the east
end of New-street, the two ends of Worcester-street,
Smallbrook-street, Cannon-street, New-meeting-streer, and Bull
street; it is easy to see which end of a street was formed first;
perhaps the south end of Moor street is two thousand years older
than the north; the same errors are also committing in our day, as
in Hill and Vale streets, the two Hinkleys and Catharine-street.
One generation, for want of foresight, forms a narrow entrance, and
another widens it by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>Every word in the English language carries an idea: when a word,
therefore, strikes the ear, the mind immediately forms a picture,
which represents it as faithfully as the looking-glass the
face.--Thus, when the word Birmingham occurs, a superb picture
instantly expands in the mind, which is best explained by the other
words grand, populous, extensive, active, commercial and humane.
This painting is an exact counter-part of the word at this day; but
it does not correspond with its appearance, in the days of the
ancient Britons--We must, therefore, for a moment, detach the idea
from the word.</p>
<p>Let us suppose, then, this centre surrounded with less than one
hundred stragling huts, without order, which we will dignify with
the name of houses; built of timber, the interfaces wattled with
sticks, and plaistered with mud, covered with thatch, boards or
sods; none of them higher than the ground story. The meaner sort
only one room, which served for three uses, shop, kitchen, and
lodging room; the door for two, it admitted the people and the
light. The better sort two rooms, and some three, for work, for the
kitchen, and for rest; all three in a line, and sometimes fronting
the street.</p>
<p>If the curious reader chooses to see a picture of Birmingham, in
the time of the Britons, he will find one in the turnpike road,
between Hales-owen and Stourbridge, called the Lie Waste, alias Mud
City. The houses stand in every direction, composed of one large
and ill-formed brick, scoped into a tenement, burnt by the sun, and
often destroyed by the frost: the males naked; the females
accomplished breeders. The children, at the age of three months,
take a singular hue from the sun and the soil, which continues for
life. The rags which cover them leave no room for the observer to
guess at the sex. Only one person upon the premisses presumes to
carry a belly, and he a landlord. We might as well look for the
moon in a coal-pit, as for stays or white linen in the City of Mud.
The principal tool in business is the hammer, and the beast of
burden, the ass.</p>
<p>The extent of our little colony of artists, perhaps reached
nearly as high as the east end of New-street, occupied the upper
part of Spiceal-street, and penetrated down the hill to the top of
Digbeth, chiefly on the east.</p>
<p>Success, which ever waits on Industry, produced a gradual, but
very slow increase: perhaps a thousand years elapsed without adding
half that number of houses.</p>
<p>Thus our favourite plantation having taken such firm root, that
she was able to stand the wintry blasts of fortune, we shall
digress for a moment, while she wields her sparkling heat,
according to the fashion of the day, in executing the orders of the
sturdy Briton; then of the polite and heroic Roman; afterwards of
our mild ancestors, the Saxons. Whether she raised her hammer for
the plundering Dane is uncertain, his reign being short; and,
lastly, for the resolute and surly Norman.</p>
<p>It does not appear that Birmingham, from its first formation, to
the present day, was ever the habitation of a gentleman, the lords
of the manor excepted. But if there are no originals among us, we
can produce many striking likenesses--The smoke of Birmingham has
been very propitious to their growth, but not to their
maturity.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, as well as buttons, have been stamped here; but, like
them, when finished, are moved off.</p>
<p>They both originate from a very uncouth state, <i>without form
or comeliness</i>; and pass through various stages, uncertain of
success. Some of them, at length, receive the last polish, and
arrive at perfection; while others, ruined by a flaw, are deemed
<i>wasters</i>.</p>
<p>I have known the man of opulence direct his gilt chariot
<i>out</i> of Birmingham, who first approached her an helpless
orphan in rags. I have known the chief magistrate of fifty thousand
people, fall from his phaeton, and humbly ask bread at a parish
vestry.</p>
<p>Frequently the wheel of capricious fortune describes a circle,
in the rotation of which, a family experiences alternately, the
heighth of prosperity and the depth of distress; but more
frequently, like a pendulum, it describes only the arc of a circle,
and that always at the bottom.</p>
<p>Many fine estates have been struck out of the anvil, valuable
possessions raised by the tongs, and superb houses, in a two-fold
sense, erected by the trowel.</p>
<p>The paternal ancestor of the late Sir Charles Holte was a native
of this place, and purchaser, in the beginning of Edward the Third,
of the several manors, which have been the honour and the support
of his house to the present time.</p>
<p>Walter Clodshale was another native of Birmingham, who, in 1332,
purchased the manor of Saltley, now enjoyed by his maternal
descendant, Charles Bowyer Adderley, Esq.</p>
<p>Charles Colmore, Esq; holds a considerable estate in the parish;
his predecessor is said to have occupied, in the reign of Henry the
Eighth, that house, now No. 1, in the High-street, as a mercer, and
general receiver of the taxes.</p>
<p>A numerous branch of this ancient family flourishes in
Birmingham at this day.</p>
<p>The head of it, in the reign of James the First, erected
New-hall, and himself into a gentleman. On this desirable eminence,
about half a mile from the buildings, they resided till time,
fashion, and success, removed them, like their predecessors, the
sons of fortune, to a greater distance.</p>
<p>The place was then possessed by a tenant, as a farm; but
Birmingham, a speedy traveller, marched over the premises, and
covered them with twelve hundred houses, on building leases; the
farmer was converted into a steward: his brown hempen frock, which
guarded the <i>outside</i> of his waistcoat, became white holland,
edged with ruffles, and took its station <i>within</i>: the
pitchfork was metamorphosed into a pen, and his ancient practice of
breeding up sheep, was changed into that of <i>dressing their
skins</i>.</p>
<p>Robert Philips, Esq; acquired a valuable property in the
seventeenth century; now possessed by his descendant, William
Theodore Inge, Esquire.</p>
<p>A gentleman of the name of Foxall, assured me, that the head of
his family resided upon the spot, now No. 101, in Digbeth, about
four hundred years ago, in the capacity of a tanner.</p>
<p>Richard Smallbroke, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, in the
reign of George II. was a native of Birmingham, as his ancestors
were for many ages, with reputation: he is said to have been born
at number 2 in the High-street, had great property in the town, now
enjoyed by his descendants, though they have left the place. The
families also of Weaman, Jennings, Whalley, etc. have acquired vast
property, and quitted the meridian of Birmingham; and some others
are at this day ripe for removal. Let me close this bright scene of
prosperity, and open another, which can only be viewed with a
melancholy eye. We cannot behold the distresses of man without
compassion; but that distress which follows affluence, comes with
double effect.</p>
<p>We have amongst us a family of the name of Middlemore, of great
antiquity, deducible from the conquest; who held the chief
possessions, and the chief offices in the county, and who matched
into the first families in the kingdom, but fell with the interest
of Charles the First; and are now in that low ebb of fortune, that
I have frequently, with a gloomy pleasure, relieved them at the
common charity-board of the town. Such is the tottering point of
human greatness.</p>
<p>Another of the name of Bracebridge, who for more than six
hundred years, figured in the first ranks of life.</p>
<p>A third of the name of Mountfort, who shone with meridian
splendor, through a long train of ages. As genealogy was ever a
favourite amusement, I have often conversed with these solitary
remains of tarnished lustre, but find in all of them, the pride of
their family buried with its greatness:--they pay no more attention
to the arms of their ancestors, than to a scrap of paper, with
which they would light their pipe. Upon consulting one of the name
of Elwall, said to be descended from the Britons, I found him so
amazingly defective, that he could not stretch his pedigree even so
high as his grandfather.</p>
<p>A fifth family amongst us, of the name of Arden, stood upon the
pinnacle of fame in the days of Alfred the Great, where perhaps
they had stood for ages before: they continued the elevation about
seven hundred years after; but having treasonable charges brought
against them, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, about two hundred
years ago, they were thrown from this exalted eminence, and dashed
to pieces in the fall. In various consultations with a member of
this honourable house, I found the greatness of his family not only
lost, but the memory of it also. I assured him, that his family
stood higher in the scale of honour, than any private one within my
knowledge: that his paternal ancestors, for about seven
generations, were successively Earls of Warwick, before the Norman
conquest: that, though he could not boast a descent from the famous
Guy, he was related to him: that, though Turchell, Earl of Warwick
at the conquest, his direct ancestor, lost the Earldom in favour of
Roger Newburgh, a favourite of William's; yet, as the Earl did not
appear in arms, against the Conqueror, at the battle of Hastings,
nor oppose the new interest, he was allowed to keep forty-six of
his manors: that he retired upon his own vast estate, which he held
in dependence, where the family resided with great opulence, in one
house, for many centuries, 'till their reduction above-mentioned.
He received the information with some degree of amazement, and
replied with a serious face,--"Perhaps there may have been
something great in my predecessors, for my grandfather kept several
cows in Birmingham and sold milk."</p>
<p>The families of those ancient heroes, of Saxon and Norman race,
are, chiefly by the mutations of time, and of state, either become
extinct, or as above, reduced to the lowest verge of fortune. Those
few therefore, whose descent is traceable, may be carried higher
than that of the present nobility; for I know none of these last,
who claim peerage beyond Edward the first, about 1295. Hence it
follows, that for antiquity, alliance, and blood, the advantage is
evidently in favour of the lowest class.</p>
<p>Could one of those illustrious shades return to the earth and
inspect human actions, he might behold one of his descendants,
dancing at the lathe; another tippling with his dark brethren of
the apron; a third humbly soliciting from other families such
favours as were formerly granted by his own; a fourth imitating
modern grandeur, by contracting debts he never designs to pay; and
a fifth snuff of departed light, poaching, like a thief in the
night, upon the very manors, possessed by his ancestors.</p>
<p>Whence is it that title, pedigree, and alliance, in superior
life, are esteemed of the highest value; while in the inferior, who
have a prior claim, are totally neglected? The grand design of
every creature upon earth, is to supply the wants of nature. No
amusements of body or mind can be adopted, till hunger is served.
When the appetite calls, the whole attention of the animal, with
all its powers, is bound to answer. Hence arise those dreadful
contests in the brute creation, from the lion in the woods, to the
dog, who seizes the bone. Hence the ship, when her provisions are
spent, and she becalmed, casts a savage eye, upon human sacrifices;
and hence, the attention of the lower ranks of men, are too far
engrossed for mental pursuit. They see, like Esau, the honours of
their family devoured with a ravenous appetite. A man with an empty
cupboard would make but a wretched philosopher. But if fortune
should smile upon one of the lower race, raise him a step above his
original standing, and give him a prospect of independence, he
immediately begins to eye the arms upon carriages, examines old
records for his name, and inquires where the Herald's office is
kept. Thus, when the urgency of nature is set at liberty, the bird
can whistle upon the branch, the fish play upon the surface, the
goat skip upon the mountain, and even man himself, can bask in the
sunshine of science. I digress no farther.</p>
<p>The situation of St. Martin's church is another reason for
fixing the original centre of Birmingham at the Old Cross.
Christianity made an early and a swift progress in this kingdom;
persecution, as might be expected, followed her footsteps,
increased her votaries, and, as was ever the case, in all new
religions, her proselytes were very devout.</p>
<p>The religious fervor of the christians displayed itself in
building churches. Most of those in England are of Saxon original,
and were erected between the fourth and the tenth century; that of
St. Martin's is ancient beyond the reach of historical knowledge,
and probably rose in the early reigns of the Saxon kings.</p>
<p>It was the custom of those times, to place the church, if there
was but one, out of the precincts of the town; this is visible at
the present day in those places which have received no
increase.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will not be an unreasonable supposition to fix the
erection of St. Martin's, in the eighth century; and if the
inquisitive reader chooses to traverse the town a second time, he
may find its boundaries something like the following. We cannot
allow its extension northward beyond the east end of New-street;
that it included the narrow parts of Philip street, Bell street,
Spiceal street, Moor street, and Park street. That the houses at
this period were more compact than heretofore; that Digbeth and
Deritend, lying in the road to Stratford, Warwick, and Coventry,
all places of antiquity, were now formed. Thus the church stood in
the environs of the town, unincumbered with buildings. Possibly
this famous nursery of arts might, by this time, produce six
hundred houses. A town must increase before its appendages are
formed; those appendages also must increase before there is a
necessity for an additional chapel, and after that increase, the
inhabitants may wait long before that necessity is removed.
Deritend is an appendage to Birmingham; the inhabitants of this
hamlet having long laboured under the inconveniency of being remote
from the parish church of Aston, and too numerous for admission
into that of Birmingham, procured a grant in 1381 to erect a chapel
of their own. If we, therefore, allow three hundred years for the
infancy of Deritend, three hundred more for her maturity, and four
hundred since the erection of her chapel, which is a very
reasonable allowance. It will bring us to the time I mentioned.</p>
<p>It does not appear that Deritend was attended with any
considerable augmentation, from the Norman conquest to the year
1767, when a turnpike-road was opened to Alcester, and when Henry
Bradford publicly offered a freehold to the man who should first
build upon his estate; since which time Deritend has made a rapid
progress: and this dusky offspring of Birmingham is now travelling
apace along her new formed road.</p>
<p>I must again recline upon Dugdale.--In 1309, William de
Birmingham, Lord of the Manor, took a distress of the inhabitants
of Bromsgrove and King's-norton, for refusing to pay the customary
tolls of the market. The inhabitants, therefore, brought their
action and recovered damage, because it was said, their lands being
the ancient demesne of the crown, they had a right to sell their
produce in any market in the King's dominions.</p>
<p>It appeared in the course of the trial, that the ancestors of
William de Birmingham had a MARKET HERE before the Norman conquest!
I shall have occasion, in future, to resume this remarkable
expression. I have also met with an old author, who observes, that
Birmingham was governed by two Constables in the time of the
Saxons; small places have seldom more than one. These evidences
prove much in favour of the government, population, and antiquity
of the place.</p>
<p>In Domesday-book it is rated at four hides of land. A hide was
as much as a team could conveniently plough in a year; perhaps at
that time about fifty acres: I think there is not now, more than
two hundred ploughed in the parish.</p>
<p>It was also said to contain woods of half a mile in length, and
four furlongs in breadth. What difference subsisted between half a
mile and four furlongs, in ancient time, is uncertain; we know of
none now. The mile was reduced to its present standard in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth: neither are there the least traces of those
woods, for at this day it is difficult to find a stick that
deserves the name of a tree, in the whole manor.--Timber is no part
of the manufactory of Birmingham.</p>
<p>Let us survey the town a third time, as we may reasonably
suppose it stood in the most remarkable period of English history,
that of the conquest.</p>
<p>We cannot yet go farther North of the centre than before, that
is, along the High-street, 'till we meet the East end of New
street. We shall penetrate rather farther into Moor-street, none
into Park-street, take in Digbeth, Deritend, Edgbaston-street, as
being the road to Dudley, Bromsgrove, and the whole West of
England; Spiceal-street, the Shambles, a larger part of Bell
street, and Philip-street.</p>
<p>The ancient increase of the town was towards the South, because
of the great road, the conveniency of water, the church, and the
manor-house, all which lay in that quarter: but the modern
extension was chiefly towards the North, owing to the scions of her
trades being transplanted all over the country, in that direction,
as far as Wednesbury, Walsall, and Wolverhampton. But particularly
her vicinity to the coal delphs, which were ever considered as the
soul of her prosperity. Perhaps by this time the number of houses
might have been augmented to seven hundred: but whatever was her
number, either in this or any other period, we cannot doubt her
being populous in every &aelig;ra of her existence.</p>
<p>The following small extract from the register, will show a
gradual increase, even before the restoration:</p>

<p>In 1251, William de Birmingham, Lord of the Manor, procured an
additional charter from Henry the Third, reviving some decayed
privileges and granting others; among the last was that of the
Whitsuntide fair, to begin on the eve of Holy Thursday, and to
continue four days. At the alteration of the style, in 1752, it was
prudently changed to the Thursday in Whitsun week; that less time
might be lost to the injury of work and the workman. He also
procured another fair, to begin on the eve of St. Michael, and
continue for three days. Both which fairs are at this day in great
repute.</p>
<p>By the interest of Audomore de Valance, earl of Pembroke, a
licence was obtained from the crown, in 1319 to charge an
additional toll upon every article sold in the market for three
years, towards paving the town. Every quarter of corn to pay one
farthing, and other things in proportion.</p>
<p>We have no reason to believe that either the town or the market
were small at that time, however, at the expiration of the term,
the toll was found inadequate to the expence, and the work lay
dormant for eighteen years, till 1337, when a second licence was
obtained, equal to the first, which completed the intention.</p>
<p>Those streets, thus dignified with a pavement, or rather their
sides, to accommodate the foot passenger, probably were
High-street, the Bull-ring, Corn-cheaping, Digbeth, St.
Martin's-lane, Moat-lane, Edgbaston-street, Spiceal-street, and
part of Moor-street.</p>
<p>It was the practice, in those early days, to leave the center of
a street unpaved, for the easier passage of carriages and horses;
the consequence was, in flat streets the road became extremely
dirty, almost impassable, and in a descent, the soil was quickly
worn away, and left a causeway on each side. Many instances of this
ancient practice are within memory.</p>
<p>The streets, no doubt, in which the fairs were held, mark the
boundaries of the town in the thirteenth century. Though smaller
wares were sold upon the spot used for the market, the rougher
articles, such as cattle, were exposed to sale in what were then
the <i>out-streets</i>. The fair for horses was held in
Edgbaston-street, and that for beasts in the High-street, tending
towards the Welch Cross.</p>
<p>Inconvenient as these streets seem for the purpose, our dark
ancestors, of peaceable memory, found no detriment, during the
infant state of population, in keeping them there. But we, their
crowded sons, for want of accommodation, have wisely removed both;
the horse-fair, in 1777, to Brick-kiln-lane, now the extreme part
of the town; and that for beasts, in 1769, into the open part of
Dale-end.</p>
<p>Whatever veneration we may entertain for ancient custom, there
is sometimes a necessity to break it. Were we now to solicit the
crown for a fair, those streets would be the last we should fix
on.</p>
<p>If we survey Birmingham in the twelfth century, we shall find
her crowded with timber, within and without; her streets dirty and
narrow; but considering the distant period, much trodden, yet,
compared with her present rising state, but little.</p>
<p>The inhabitant became an early encroacher upon nor narrow
streets, and sometimes the lord was the greatest. Her houses were
mean and low, but few reaching higher than one story, perhaps none
more than two; composed of wood and plaister--she was a stranger to
brick. Her public buildings consisted solely of one, <i>the
church</i>.</p>
<p>If we behold her in the fourteenth century, we shall observe her
private buildings multiplied more than improved; her narrow
streets, by trespass, become narrower, for she was ever chargeable
with neglect; her public buildings increased to four, two in the
town, and two at a distance, the Priory, of stone, founded by
contribution, at the head of which stood her lord; the Guild, of
timber, now the Free School; and Deritend Chapel, of the same
materials, resembling a barn, with something like an awkward
dove-coat, at the west end, by way of steeple. All these will be
noticed in due course.</p>
<p>If we take a view of the inhabitants, we shall find them
industrious, plain, and honest; the more of the former, generally,
the less of dishonesty, if their superiors lived in an homelier
stile in that period, it is no wonder <i>they</i> did. Perhaps our
ancestors acquired more money than their neighbours, and not much
of that; but what they had was extremely valuable: diligence will
accumulate. In curious operations, known only to a few, we may
suppose the artist was amply paid.</p>
<p>Nash, in his History of Worcestershire, gives us a curious list
of anecdotes, from the church-wardens ledger, of Hales-Owen. I
shall transcribe two, nearly three hundred years old. "<i>Paid for
bread and ale, to make my Lord Abbot drink, in Rogation week,
2d.</i>" What should we now think of an ecclesiastical nobleman,
accepting a two-penny treat from a country church-warden?</p>
<p>This displays an instance of moderation in a class of people
famous for luxury. It shows also the amazing reduction of money:
the same sum which served my Lord Abbot four days, would now be
devoured in four minutes.--"1498, <i>paid for repeyling the organs,
to the organmaker at Bromicham</i>, 10<i>s</i>." Birmingham then,
we find, discovered the powers of genius in the finer arts, as well
as in iron. By '<i>the</i> organmaker,' we mould suppose there was
but one.</p>
<p>It appears that the art of acquiring riches was as well
understood by our fathers, as by us; while an artist could receive
as much money for tuning an organ, as would purchase an acre of
land, or treat near half a gross of Lord Abbots.</p>

<h2><a name="BATTLE_OF_CAMP-HILL."></a>BATTLE OF CAMP-HILL.</h2>
<h3>1643.</h3>
<br>
<p>Clarendon reproaches with virulence, our spirited ancestors, for
disloyalty to Charles the First.--The day after the King left
Birmingham, on his march from Shrewsbury, in 1642, they seized his
carriages, containing the royal plate and furniture, which they
conveyed, for security, to Warwick Castle. They apprehended all
messengers and suspected persons; frequently attacked, and reduced
small parties of the royalists, whom they sent prisoners to
Coventry.--Hence the proverbial expression of a refractory person,
<i>Send him to Coventry</i>.</p>
<p>In 1643, the King ordered Prince Rupert, with a detachment of
two thousand men, to open a communication between Oxford and York.
In his march to Birmingham, he found a company of foot, kept for
the parliament, lately reinforced by a troop of horse from the
garrison at Lichfield: but, supposing they would not resist a power
of ten to one, sent his quarter masters to demand lodging, and
offer protection.</p>
<p>But the sturdy sons of freedom, having cast up slight works at
each end of the town, and barricaded the lesser avenues, rejected
the offer and the officers. The military uniting in one small and
compact body, assisted by the inhabitants, were determined the
King's forces mould not enter. Their little fire opened on the
Prince: but bravery itself, though possessed of an excellent spot
of ground for defence, was obliged to give way to numbers. The
Prince quickly put them to silence; yet, under the success of his
own arms, he was not able to enter the town, for the inhabitants
had choaked up, with carriages, the deep and narrow road, then
between Deritend and Camp-hill, which obliged the Prince to alter
his route to the left, and proceed towards Long-bridge.</p>
<p>The spirit of resistance was not yet broken; they sustained a
second attack, but to no purpose, except that of laughter. A
running fight continued through the town; victory declared loudly
for the Prince; the retreat became general: part of the vanquished
took the way to Oldbury.</p>
<p>William Fielding, Earl of Denbigh, a volunteer under the Prince,
being in close pursuit of an officer in the service of the
parliament, and both upon the full gallop, up Shirland-lane, in the
manor of Smethwick, the officer instantly turning, discharged a
pistol at the Earl, and mortally wounded him with a random
shot.</p>
<p>The parliament troops were animated in the engagement by a
clergyman, who acted as governor, but being taken in the defeat,
and refusing quarter, was killed in the Red Lion-inn.</p>
<p>The Prince, provoked at the resistance, in revenge, set fire to
the town. His wrath is said to have kindled in Bull-street, and
consumed several houses near the spot, now No. 12.</p>
<p>He obliged the inhabitants to quench the flames with a heavy
fine, to prevent farther military execution. Part of the fine is
said to have been shoes and stockings for his people.</p>
<p>The parliament forces had formed their camp in that well chosen
angle, which divides the Stratford and Warwick roads, upon
Camp-hill.</p>
<p>The victorious Prince left no garrison, because their
insignificant works were untenable; but left an humbled people, and
marched to the reduction of Lichfield.</p>
<p>In 1665, London was not only visited with the plague, but many
other parts of England, among which, Birmingham felt this dreadful
mark of the divine judgment.</p>
<p>The infection is said to have been caught by a box of clothes,
brought by the carrier, and lodged at the White-hart. Depopulation
ensued. The church-yard was insufficient for the reception of the
dead, who were conveyed to Ladywood-green, one acre of waste land,
then denominated the Pelt Ground.</p>
<p>The charter for the market has evidently been repeated by divers
kings, both Saxon and Norman, but when first granted is uncertain,
perhaps at an early Saxon date; and the day seems never to have
been changed from Thursday.</p>
<p>The lords were tenacious of their privileges; or, one would
think, there was no need to renew their charter. Prescription,
necessity, and increasing numbers, would establish the right.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in a Saxon period, there was room sufficient in our
circumscribed market-place, for the people and their weekly
supplies; but now, their supplies would fill it, exclusive of the
people.</p>
<p>Thus by a steady and a persevering hand, she kept a constant and
uniform stroke at the anvil, through a vast succession of ages:
rising superior to the frowns of fortune: establishing a variety of
productions from iron: ever improving her inventive powers, and
perhaps, changing a number of her people, equal to her whole
inhabitants, every sixteen years, till she arrived at another
important period, the end of the civil wars of Charles the
first.</p>

<h2><a name="MODERN_STATE"></a>MODERN STATE</h2>
<h3>OF</h3>
<h2>BIRMINGHAM.</h2>
<br>
<p>It is the practice of the historian, to divide ancient history
from modern, at the fall of the Roman Empire. For, during a course
of about seven hundred years, while the Roman name beamed in
meridian splendour, the lustre of her arms and political conduct
influenced, more or less, every country in Europe. But at the fall
of that mighty empire, which happened in the fifth century, every
one of the conquered provinces was left to stand upon its own
basis. From this period, therefore, the history of nations takes a
material turn. The English historian divides his ancient account
from the modern, at the extinction of the house of Plantagenet, in
1485, the fall of Richard the Third. For, by the introduction of
letters, an amazing degree of light was thrown upon science, and
also, by a new system of politics, adopted by Henry the Seventh,
the British constitution, occasioned by one little act of
parliament, that of allowing liberty to sell land, took a very
different, and an important course.</p>
<p>But the ancient and modern state of Birmingham, must divide at
the restoration of Charles the Second. For though she had before,
held a considerable degree of eminence; yet at this period, the
curious arts began to take root, and were cultivated by the hand of
genius. Building leases, also, began to take effect, extension
followed, and numbers of people crowded upon each other, as into a
Paradise.</p>
<p>As a kind tree, perfectly adapted for growth, and planted in a
suitable soil, draws nourishment from the circumjacent ground, to a
great extent, and robs the neighbouring plants of their support,
that nothing can thrive within its influence; so Birmingham, half
whose inhabitants above the age of ten, perhaps, are not natives,
draws her annual supply of hands, and is constantly fed by the
towns that surround her, where her trades are not practised.
Preventing every increase to those neighbours who kindly contribute
to her wants. This is the case with Bromsgrove, Dudley,
Stourbridge, Sutton, Lichfield, Tamworth, Coleshill, and
Solihull.</p>
<p>We have taken a view of Birmingham in several periods of
existence, during the long course of perhaps three thousand years.
Standing sometimes upon presumptive ground. If the prospect has
been a little clouded, it only caused us to be more attentive, that
we might not be deceived. But, though we have attended her through
so immense a space, we have only seen her in infancy. Comparatively
small in her size, homely in her person, and coarse in her dress.
Her ornaments, wholly of iron, from her own forge.</p>
<p>But now, her growths will be amazing; her expansion rapid,
perhaps not to be paralleled in history. We shall see her rise in
all the beauty of youth, of grace, of elegance, and attract the
notice of the commercial world. She will also add to her iron
ornaments, the lustre of every metal, that the whole earth can
produce, with all their illustrious race of compounds, heightened
by fancy, and garnished with jewels. She will draw from the fossil,
and the vegetable kingdoms; press the ocean for shell, skin and
coral. She will also tax the animal, for horn, bone, and ivory, and
she will decorate the whole with the touches of her pencil.</p>
<p>I have met with some remarks, published in 1743, wherein the
author observes, "That Birmingham, at the restoration, probably
consisted only of three streets." But it is more probable it
consisted of fifteen, though not all finished, and about nine
hundred houses.</p>
<p>I am sensible, when an author strings a parcel of streets
together, he furnishes but a dry entertainment for his reader,
especially to a stranger. But, as necessity demands intelligence
from the historian, I must beg leave to mention the streets and
their supposed number of houses.</p>

<p>The same author farther observes, "That from the Restoration to
the year 1700, the streets of Birmingham were increased to thirty
one." But I can make their number only twenty-eight, and many of
these far from complete. Also, that the whole number of houses were
2,504, and the inhabitants 15,032. The additional streets therefore
seem to have been Castle-street, Carr's-lane, Dale-end,
Stafford-street, Bull lane, Pinfold-street, Colmore-street, the
Froggery, Old Meeting-street, Worcester-street, Peck-lane,
New-street, (a small part,) Lower Mill-lane.</p>
<p>From the year 1700 to 1731, there is said to have been a farther
addition of twenty-five streets, I know of only twenty-three: and
also of 1,215 houses, and 8,250 inhabitants. Their names we offer
as under;--Freeman-street, New Meeting-street, Moor-street, (the
North part), Wood-street, the Butts, Lichfield-street;
Thomas's-street, John's-street, London-'prentice street, Lower
priory, The Square, Upper-priory, Minories, Steel-house-lane,
Cherry-street, Cannon-street, Needless-alley, Temple-street, King's
street, Queen-street, Old Hinkleys, Smallbrook-street, and the East
part of Hill-street.</p>
<p>I first saw Birmingham July 14, 1741, and will therefore
perambulate its boundaries at that time with my traveller,
beginning at the top of Snow-hill, keeping the town on our left,
and the fields that then were, on our right.</p>
<p>Through Bull-lane we proceed to Temple-street; down Peck lane,
to the top of Pinfold-street; Dudley-street, the Old Hinkleys to
the top of Smallbrook street, back through Edgbaston-street,
Digbeth, to the upper end of Deritend. We shall return through
Park-street, Mass-house-lane, the North of Dale end,
Stafford-street, Steel-house-lane, to the top of Snow-hill, from
whence we set out.</p>
<p>If we compare this account with that of 1731, we shall not find
any great addition of streets; but those that were formed before,
were much better filled up. The new streets erected during these
ten years were Temple-row, except about six houses. The North of
Park-street, and of Dale-end; also, Slaney-street, and a small part
of the East side of Snow hill.</p>
<p>From 1741, to the present year 1780, Birmingham seems to have
acquired the amazing augmentation of seventy one streets, 4172
houses, and 25,032 inhabitants.</p>
<p>Thus her internal property is covered with new-erected
buildings, tier within tier. Thus she opens annually, a new aspect
to the traveller; and thus she penetrates along the roads that
surround her, as if to unite with the neighbouring towns, for their
improvement in commerce, in arts, and in civilization.</p>
<p>I have often led my curious enquirer round Birmingham, but, like
the thread round the swelling clue, never twice in the same tract.
We shall therefore, for the last time, examine her present
boundaries. Our former journey commenced at the top of Snow-hill,
we now set off from the bottom.</p>
<p>The present buildings extend about forty yards beyond the
Salutation, on the Wolverhampton road. We now turn up
Lionel-street, leaving St. Paul's, and about three new erected
houses, on the right<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1">[1]</a>; pass close to New-Hall, leaving it on the
left, to the top of Great Charles-street, along Easy-hill: we now
leave the Wharf to the right, down Suffolk-street, in which are
seventy houses, leaving two infant streets also to the right, in
which are about twelve houses each: up to Holloway-head, thence to
Windmill-hill, Bow-street, Brick-kiln-lane, down to Lady-well,
along Pudding-brook, to the Moat, Lloyd's Slitting-mill, Digbeth,
over Deritend bridge, thence to the right, for Cheapside; cross the
top of Bradford-street, return by the Bridge to Floodgate-street,
Park-street, Bartholomew's-chapel, Grosvenor-street, Nova
scotia-street, Woodcock-lane, Aston-street, Lancaster-street,
Walmer-lane, Price's-street, Bath-street, to the bottom of
Snow-hill.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a>
The above was written in May 1780, and the three houses are now,
March 14, 1781, multiplied into fifty-five.</blockquote>
<p>The circle I have described is about five miles, in which is
much ground to be filled up. There are also beyond this crooked
line, five clumps of houses belonging to Birmingham, which may be
deemed hamlets.</p>
<p>At the Sand-pits upon the Dudley-road, about three furlongs from
the buildings, are fourteen houses.</p>
<p>Four furlongs from the Navigation-office, upon the road to
Hales-owen, are twenty-nine.</p>
<p>One furlong from Exeter row, towards the hand, are
thirty-four.</p>
<p>Upon Camp-hill, 130 yards from the junction of the Warwick and
Coventry roads, which is the extremity of the present buildings,
are thirty-one.</p>
<p>And two furlongs from the town, in Walmer-lane, are seventeen
more.</p>
<p>I shall comprize, in one view, the state of Birmingham in eight
different periods of time. And though some are imaginary, perhaps
they are not far from real.</p>

<p>In 1778, Birmingham, exclusive of the appendages, contained 8042
houses, 48252 inhabitants.</p>
<p>At the same time, Manchester consisted of 3402, houses, and
22440 people.</p>
<p>In 1779, Nottingham contained 3191 houses, and 17711 souls.</p>
<p>It is easy to see, without the spirit of prophecy, that
Birmingham hath not yet arrived at her zenith, neither is she
likely to reach it for ages to come. Her increase will depend upon
her manufactures; her manufactures will depend upon the national
commerce; national commerce, will depend upon a superiority at sea;
and this superiority may be extended to a long futurity.</p>
<p>The interior parts of the town, are like those of other places,
parcelled out into small free-holds, perhaps, originally purchased
of the Lords of the Manor; but, since its amazing increase, which
began about the restoration, large tracts of land have been
huxtered out upon building leases.</p>
<p>Some of the first that were granted, seem to have been about
Worcester and Colmore streets, at the trifling annual price of one
farthing per yard, or under.</p>
<p>The market ran so much against the lesor, that the lessee had
liberty to build in what manner he pleased; and, at the expiration
of the term, could remove the buildings unless the other chose to
purchase them. But the market, at this day, is so altered, that the
lessee gives four-pence per yard; is tied to the mode of building,
and obliged to leave the premisses in repair.</p>
<p>The itch for building is predominant: we dip our fingers into
mortar almost as soon as into business. It is not wonderful that a
person should be hurt by the <i>falling</i> of a house; but, with
us, a man sometimes breaks his back by <i>raising</i> one.</p>
<p>This private injury, however, is attended with a public benefit
of the first magnitude; for every "<i>House to be Let</i>," holds
forth a kind of invitation to the stranger to settle in it, who,
being of the laborious class, promotes the manufactures.</p>
<p>If we cannot produce many houses of the highest orders in
architecture, we make out the defect in numbers. Perhaps
<i>more</i> are erected here, in a given time, than in any place in
the whole island, London excepted.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that in a town like Birmingham, where so many
houses are built, the art of building is so little understood. The
stile of architecture in the inferior sort, is rather showy than
lasting.</p>
<p>The proprietor generally contracts for a house of certain
dimensions, at a stipulated price: this induces the artist to use
some ingredients of the cheaper kind, and sometimes to try whether
he can cement the materials with sand, instead of lime.</p>
<p>But a house is not the only thing spoilt by the builder; he
frequently spoils himself: out of many successions of house-makers,
I cannot recollect one who made a fortune.</p>
<p>Many of these edifices have been brought forth, answered the
purposes for which they were created, and been buried in the dust,
during my short acquaintance with Birmingham. One would think, if a
man can survive a house, he has no great reason to complain of the
shortness of life.</p>
<p>From the external genteel appearance of a house, the stranger
would be tempted to think the inhabitant possessed at least a
thousand pounds; but, if he looks within, he sees only the ensigns
of beggary.</p>
<p>We have people who enjoy four or five hundred pounds a year in
houses, none of which, perhaps, exceed six pounds per annum. It may
excite a smile, to say, I have known two houses erected, one
occupied by a man, his wife, and three children; the other pair had
four; and twelve guineas covered every expence.</p>
<p>Pardon, my dear reader, the omission of a pompous encomium on
their beauty, or duration.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think two thirds of the houses in Birmingham
stand upon new foundations, and all the places of worship, except
Deritend Chapel.</p>
<p>About the year 1730, Thomas Sherlock, late Bishop of London,
purchased the private estate of the ladies of the manor, chiefly
land, about four hundred per annum.</p>
<p>In 1758, the steward told me it had increased to twice the
original value. The pious old Bishop was frequently solicited to
grant building leases, but answered, "His land was valuable, and if
built upon, his successor, at the expiration of the term, would
have the rubbish to carry off:" he therefore not only refused, but
prohibited his successor from granting such leases.</p>
<p>But Sir Thomas Gooch, who succeeded him, seeing the great
improvement of the neighbouring estates, and wisely judging fifty
pounds per acre preferable to five, procured an act in about 1766,
to set aside the prohibiting clause in the Bishop's will.</p>
<p>Since which, a considerable town may be said to have been
erected upon his property, now about 1600<i>l</i>. per annum.</p>
<p>An acquaintance assured me, that in 1756 he could have purchased
the house he then occupied for 400<i>l</i>. but refused. In 1770,
the same house was sold for 600<i>l</i>. and in 1772, I purchased
it for eight hundred and thirty-five guineas, without any
alteration, but what time had made for the worse: and for this
enormous price I had only an old house, which I was obliged to take
down. Such is the rapid improvement in value, of landed property,
in a commercial country.</p>
<p>Suffer me to add, though foreign to my subject, that these
premises were the property of an ancient family of the name of
Smith, now in decay; where many centuries ago one of the first inns
in Birmingham, and well known by the name of the Garland House,
perhaps from the sign; but within memory, Potter's
Coffee-house.</p>
<p>Under one part was a room about forty-five feet long, and
fifteen wide, used for the town prison.</p>
<p>In sinking a cellar we found a large quantity of tobacco-pipes
of a angular construction, with some very antique earthen ware, but
no coin; also loads of broken bottles, which refutes the complaint
of our pulpits against modern degeneracy, and indicates, the
vociferous arts of getting drunk and breaking glass, were well
understood by our ancestors.</p>
<p>In penetrating a bed of sand, upon which had stood a work-shop,
about two feet below the surface we came to a tumolus six feet
long, three wide, and five deep, built very neat, with tiles laid
flat, but no cement. The contents were mouldered wood, and pieces
of human bone.</p>
<p>I know of no house in Birmingham, the inns excepted, whose
annual rent exceeds eighty pounds. By the lamp books, the united
rents appear to be about seventy thousand, which if we take at
twenty years purchase, will compose a freehold of
1,400,000<i>l</i>. value.</p>
<p>If we allow the contents of the manor to be three thousand
acres, and deduct six hundred for the town, five hundred more for
roads, water, and waste land; and rate the remaining nineteen
hundred, at the average rent of 2<i>l</i>. 10s. per acre; we shall
raise an additional freehold of 4,750<i>l</i>. per ann.</p>
<p>If we value this landed property at thirty years purchase, it
will produce 142,500<i>l</i>. and, united with the value of the
buildings, the fee-simple of this happy region of genius, will
amount to 1,542,500<i>l</i>.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="OF_THE_STREETS,"></a>OF THE STREETS,</h2>
<h3>AND</h3>
<h2>THEIR NAMES.</h2>
<br>
<p>We accuse our short-sighted ancestors, and with reason, for
leaving us almost without a church-yard and a market-place; for
forming some of our streets nearly without width, and without
light. One would think they intended a street without a passage,
when they erected Moor-street; and that their successors should
light their candles at noon.</p>
<p>Something, however, may be pleaded in excuse, by observing the
concourse of people was small, therefore a little room would
suffice; and the buildings were low, so that light would be less
obstructed: besides, we cannot guess at the future but by the
present. As the increase of the town was slow, the modern
augmentation could not then be discovered through the dark medium
of time; but the prospect into futurity is at this day rather
brighter, for we plainly see, and perhaps with more reason,
succeeding generations will blame us for neglect. We occupy the
power to reform, without the will; why else do we suffer enormities
to grow, which will have taken deep root in another age? If utility
and beauty can <i>be joined together</i> in the street, why are
they ever <i>put asunder</i>? It is easy for Birmingham to be as
rapid in her improvement, as in her growth.</p>
<p>The town consists of about 125 streets, some of which acquired
their names from a variety of causes, but some from no cause, and
others, have not yet acquired a name.</p>
<p>Those of Bull street, Cannon street, London Prentice street, and
Bell street, from the signs of their respective names.</p>
<p>Some receive theirs from the proprietors of the land, as
Smallbrook street, Freeman street, Colmore street, Slaney street,
Weaman street, Bradford street, and Colmore row.</p>
<p>Digbeth, or Ducks Bath, from the Pools for accommodating that
animal, was originally Well street, from the many springs in its
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Others derive a name from caprice, as Jamaica row, John, Thomas,
and Philip streets.</p>
<p>Some, from a desire of imitating the metropolis, as,
Fleet-street, Snow-hill, Ludgate-hill, Cheapside, and
Friday-street.</p>
<p>Some again, from local causes, as High-street, from its
elevation, St. Martin's-lane, Church-street, Cherry-street,
originally an orchard, Chapel-street, Bartholomew-row,
Mass-house-lane, Old and New Meeting-streets, Steelhouse-lane,
Temple-row and Temple-street, also Pinfold-street, from a pinfold
at No. 85, removed in 1752.</p>
<p>Moor-street, anciently Mole-street, from the eminence on one
side, or the declivity on the other.</p>
<p>Park-street seems to have acquired its name by being
appropriated to the private use of the lord of the manor, and,
except at the narrow end next Digbeth, contained only the corner
house to the south, entering Shut-lane, No. 82, lately taken down,
which was called The Lodge.</p>
<p>Spiceal-street, anciently Mercer-street, from the number of
mercers shops; and as the professors of that trade dealt in
grocery, it was promiscuously called Spicer-street. The present
name is only a corruption of the last.</p>
<p>The spot, now the Old Hinkleys, was a close, till about 1720, in
which horses were shown at the fair, then held in Edgbaston-street.
It was since a brick-yard, and contained only one hut, in which the
brick-maker slept.</p>
<p>The tincture of the smoky shops, with all their <i>black
furniture</i>, for weilding gun-barrels, which afterwards appeared
on the back of Small-brooke-street, might occasion the original
name <i>Inkleys</i>; ink is well known; leys, is of British
derivation, and means grazing ground; so that the etymology perhaps
is <i>Black pasture</i>.</p>
<p>The Butts; a mark to shoot at, when the bow was the fashionable
instrument of war, which the artist of Birmingham knew well how to
make, and to use.</p>
<p>Gosta Green (Goose-stead-Green) a name of great antiquity, now
in decline; once a track of commons, circumscribed by the Stafford
road, now Stafford-street, the roads to Lichfield and Coleshill,
now Aston and Coleshill-streets, and extending to Duke-street, the
boundary of the manor.</p>
<p>Perhaps, many ages after, it was converted into a farm, and was,
within memory, possessed by a person of the name of Tanter, whence,
Tanter-street.</p>
<p>Sometimes a street fluctuates between two names, as that of
Catharine and Wittal, which at length terminated in favour of the
former.</p>
<p>Thus the names of great George and great Charles stood
candidates for one of the finest streets in Birmingham, which after
a contest of two or three years, was carried in favour of the
latter.</p>
<p>Others receive a name from the places to which they direct, as
Worcester-street, Edgbaston-street, Dudley-street,
Lichfield-street, Aston-street, Stafford-street, Coleshill-street,
and Alcester-street.</p>
<p>A John Cooper, the same person who stands in the list of donors
in St. Martin's church, and who, I apprehend, lived about two
hundred and fifty years ago, at the Talbot, now No. 20, in the
High-street, left about four acres of land, between
Steelhouse-lane, St. Paul's chapel, and Walmer-lane, to make
love-days for the people of Birmingham; hence,
<i>Love-day-croft</i>.</p>
<p>Various sounds from the trowel upon the premises, in 1758,
produced the name of <i>Love-day-street</i> (corrupted into
Lovely-street.)</p>
<p>This croft is part of an estate under the care of Lench's Trust;
and, at the time of the bequest, was probably worth no more than
ten shillings per annum.</p>
<p>At the top of Walmer-lane, which is the north east corner of
this croft, stood about half a dozen old alms-houses, perhaps
erected in the beginning of the seventeenth century, then at a
considerable distance from the town. These were taken down in 1764,
and the present alms-houses, which are thirty-six, erected near the
spot, at the expence of the trust, to accommodate the same number
of poor widows, who have each a small annual stipend, for the
supply of coals.</p>
<p>This John Cooper, for some services rendered to the lord of the
manor, obtained three privileges, That of regulating the goodness
and price of beer, consequently he stands in the front of the whole
liquid race of high tasters; that he should, whenever he pleased,
beat a bull in the Bull-ring, whence arises the name; and, that he
should be allowed interment in the south porch of St. Martin's
church. His memory ought to be transmitted with honor, to
posterity, for promoting the harmony of his neighbourhood, but he
ought to have been buried in a dunghill, for punishing an innocent
animal.--His wife seems to have survived him, who also became a
benefactress, is recorded in the same list, and their monument, in
antique sculpture, is yet visible in the porch.</p>

<h2><a name="TRADE."></a>TRADE.</h2>
<br>
<p>Perhaps there is not by nature so much difference in the
capacities of men, as by education. The efforts of nature will
produce a ten-fold crop in the field, but those of art, fifty.</p>
<p>Perhaps too, the seeds of every virtue, vice, inclination, and
habit, are sown in the breast of every human being, though not in
an equal degree. Some of these lie dormant for ever, no hand
inviting their cultivation. Some are called into existence by their
own internal strength, and others by the external powers that
surround them. Some of these seeds flourish more, some less,
according to the aptness of the soil, and the modes of assistance.
We are not to suppose infancy the only time in which these scions
spring, no part of life is exempt. I knew a man who lived to the
age of forty, totally regardless of music. A fidler happening to
have apartments near his abode, attracted his ear, by frequent
exhibitions, which produced a growing inclination for that
favourite science, and he became a proficient himself. Thus in
advanced periods a man may fall in love with a science, a woman, or
a bottle. Thus avarice is said to shoot up in ancient soil, and
thus, I myself bud forth in history at fifty-six.</p>
<p>The cameleon is said to receive a tincture from the colour of
the object that is nearest him; but the human mind in reality
receives a bias from its connections. Link a man to the pulpit, and
he cannot proceed to any great lengths in profligate life. Enter
him into the army, and he will endeavour to swear himself into
consequence. Make the man of humanity an overseer of the poor, and
he will quickly find the tender feelings of commiseration hardened.
Make him a physician, and he will be the only person upon the
premises, the heir excepted, unconcerned at the prospect of death.
Make him a surgeon, and he will amputate a leg with the same
indifference with which a cutler saws a piece of bone for a knife
handle. You commit a rascal to prison because he merits
transportation, but by the time he comes out he merits a halter. By
uniting also with industry, we become industrious. It is easy to
give instances of people whose distinguishing characteristic was
idleness, but when they breathed the air of Birmingham, diligence
became the predominant feature. The view of profit, like the view
of corn to the hungry horse, excites to action.</p>
<p>Thus the various seeds scattered by nature into the soul at its
first formation, either lie neglected, are urged into increase by
their own powers, or are drawn towards maturity by the concurring
circumstances that attend them.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Grenville observed, in the House of Commons, "That
commerce tended to corrupt the morals of a people." If we examine
the expression, we shall find it true in a certain degree, beyond
which, it tends to improve them.</p>
<p>Perhaps every tradesman can furnish out numberless instances of
small deceit. His conduct is marked with a littleness, which though
allowed by general consent, is not strictly just. A person with
whom I have long been connected in business, asked, if I had dealt
with his relation, whom he had brought up, and who had lately
entered into commercial life. I answered in the affirmative. He
replied, "He is a very honest fellow." I told him I saw all the
finesse of a tradesman about him. "Oh, rejoined my friend, a man
has a right to say all he can in favour of his own goods." Nor is
the seller alone culpable. The buyer takes an equal share in the
deception. Though neither of them speak their sentiments, they well
understand each other. Whilst the treaty is agitating, the profit
of the tradesman vanishes, yet the buyer pronounces against the
article; but when finished, the seller whispers his friend, "It is
well sold," and the buyer smiles if a bargain.</p>
<p>Thus is the commercial track a line of minute deceits.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, it does not seem possible for a man in
trade to pass this line, without wrecking his reputation; which, if
once broken, can never be made whole. The character of a tradesman
is valuable, it is his all; therefore, whatever seeds of the
vicious kind shoot forth in the mind, are carefully watched and
nipped in the bud, that they may never blossom into action.</p>
<p>Thus having slated the accounts between morality and trade, I
shall leave the reader to draw the ballance. I shall not pronounce
after so great a master, and upon so delicate a subject, but shall
only ask, "Whether the people in trade are more corrupt than those
out?"</p>
<p>If the curious reader will lend an attentive ear to a pair of
farmers in the market, bartering for a cow, he will find as much
dissimulation as at St. James's, or at any other saint's, but
couched in homelier phrase. The man of well-bred deceit is
'<i>infinitely</i> your friend--It would give him <i>immense</i>
pleasure to serve you!' while the man in the frock 'Will be ---- if
he tells you a word of a lye!' Deception is an innate principle of
the human heart, not peculiar to one man, or one profession.</p>
<p>Having occasion for a horse, in 1759, I mentioned it to an
acquaintance, and informed him of the uses: he assured me, he had
one that would exactly suit; which he showed in the stable, and
held the candle pretty high, <i>for fear of affecting the
straw</i>. I told him it was needless to examine him, for I should
rely upon his word, being conscious he was too much my friend to
deceive me; therefore bargained, and caused him to be sent home.
But by the light of the sun, which next morning illumined the
heavens, I perceived the horse was <i>greased</i> on all fours. I
therefore, in gentle terms, upbraided my friend with duplicity,
when he replied with some warmth, "I would cheat my own brother in
a horse." Had this honourable friend stood a chance of selling me a
horse once a week, his own interest would have prevented him from
deceiving me.</p>
<p>A man enters into business with a view of acquiring a fortune--A
laudable motive! That property which rises from honest industry, is
an honour to its owner; the repose of his age; the reward of a life
of attention: but, great as the advantage seems, yet, being of a
private nature, it is one of the least in the mercantile walk. For
the intercourse occasioned by traffic, gives a man a view of the
world, and of himself; removes the narrow limits that confine his
judgment; expands the mind; opens his understanding; removes his
prejudices; and polishes his manners. Civility and humanity are
ever the companions of trade; the man of business is the man of
liberal sentiment; a barbarous and commercial people, is a
contradiction; if he is not the philosopher of nature, he is the
friend of his country, and well understands her interest. Even the
men of inferior life among us, whose occupations, one would think,
tend to produce minds as callous as the mettle they work; lay a
stronger claim to civilization, than in any other place with which
I am acquainted. I am sorry to mutilate the compliment, when I
mention the lower race of the other sex: no lady ought to be
publicly insulted, let her appear in what dress she pleases. Both
sexes, however, agree in exhibiting a mistaken pity, in cases of
punishment, particularly by preventing that for misconduct in the
military profession.</p>
<p>It is singular, that a predilection for Birmingham, is
entertained by every denomination of visitants, from Edward Duke of
York, who saw us in 1765, down to the presuming quack, who, griped
with necessity, boldly discharges his filth from the stage. A
paviour, of the name of Obrien, assured me in 1750, that he only
meant to sleep one night in Birmingham, in his way from London to
Dublin. But instead of pursuing his journey next morning, as
intended, he had continued in the place thirty-five years: and
though fortune had never elevated him above the pebbles of the
street, yet he had never repented his stay.</p>
<p>It has already been remarked that I first saw Birmingham in
1741, accidentally cast into those regions of civility; equally
unknown to every inhabitant, nor having the least idea of becoming
one myself. Though the reflections of an untaught youth of
seventeen cannot be striking, yet, as they were purely natural,
permit me to describe them.</p>
<p>I had been before acquainted with two or three principal towns.
The environs of all I had seen were composed of wretched dwellings,
replete with dirt and poverty; but the buildings in the exterior of
Birmingham rose in a style of elegance. Thatch, so plentiful in
other towns, was not to be met with in this. I was surprised at the
place, but more so at the people: They were a species I had never
seen: They possessed a vivacity I had never beheld: I had been
among dreamers, but now I saw men awake: Their very step along the
street showed alacrity: Every man seemed to know and prosecute his
own affairs: The town was large, and full of inhabitants, and those
inhabitants full of industry. I had seen faces elsewhere tinctured
with an idle gloom void of meaning, but here, with a pleasing
alertness: Their appearance was strongly marked with the modes of
civil life: I mixed a variety of company, chiefly of the lower
ranks, and rather as a silent spectator: I was treated with an easy
freedom by all, and with marks of favour by some: Hospitality
seemed to claim this happy people for her own, though I knew not at
that time from what cause.</p>
<p>I did not meet with this treatment in 1770, twenty nine years
after, at Bosworth, where I accompanied a gentleman, with no other
intent, than to view the field celebrated for the fall of Richard
the third. The inhabitants enjoyed the cruel satisfaction of
setting their dogs at us in the street, merely because we were
strangers. Human figures, not their own, are seldom seen in those
inhospitable regions: Surrounded with impassable roads, no
intercourse with man to humanise the mind, no commerce to smooth
their rugged manners, they continue the boors of nature.</p>
<p>Thus it appears, that characters are influenced by profession.
That the great advantage of private fortune, and the greater to
society, of softening and forming the mind, are the result of
trade. But these are not the only benefits that flow from this
desirable spring. It opens the hand of charity to the assistance of
distress; witness the Hospital and the two Charity Schools,
supported by annual donation: It adds to the national security, by
supplying the taxes for internal use, and, for the prosecution of
war. It adds to that security, by furnishing the inhabitants with
riches, which they are ever anxious to preserve, even at the risk
of their lives; for the preservation of private wealth, tends to
the preservation of the state.</p>
<p>It augments the value of landed property, by multiplying the
number of purchasers: It produces money to improve that land into a
higher state of cultivation, which ultimately redounds to the
general benefit, by affording plenty.</p>
<p>It unites bodies of men in social compact, for their mutual
interest: It adds to the credit and pleasure of individuals, by
enabling them to purchase entertainment and improvement, both of
the corporeal and intellectual kind.</p>
<p>It finds employment for the hand that would otherwise be found
in mischief: And it elevates the character of a nation in the scale
of government.</p>
<p>Birmingham, by her commercial consequence, has, of late, justly
assumed the liberty of nominating one of the representatives for
the county; and, to her honor, the elective body never regretted
her choice.</p>
<p>In that memorable contest of 1774, we were almost to a man of
one mind: if an <i>odd dozen</i> among us, of a different
<i>mould</i>, did not assimulate with the rest, they were treated,
as men of free judgment should ever be treated, <i>with
civility</i>, and the line of harmony was not broken.</p>
<p>If this little treatise happens to travel into some of our
corporate places, where the fire of contention, blown by the breath
of party, is kept alive during seven years, let them cast a second
glance over the above remark.</p>
<p>Some of the first words after the creation, <i>increase and
multiply</i>, are applicable to Birmingham; but as her own people
are insufficient for the manufactures, she demands assistance for
two or three miles round her. In our early morning walks, on every
road proceeding from the town, we meet the sons of diligence
returning to business, and bringing <i>in</i> the same dusky smuts,
which the evening before they took out. And though they appear of a
darkish complexion, we may consider it is the property of every
metal to sully the user; money itself has the same effect, and yet
he deems it no disgrace who is daubed by fingering it; the disgrace
lies with him who has none to finger.</p>
<p>The profits arising from labour, to the lower orders of men,
seem to surpass those of other mercantile places. This is not only
visible in the manufactures peculiar to Birmingham, but in the more
common occupations of the barber, taylor, shoe-maker, etc. who bask
in the rays of plenty.</p>
<p>It is entertaining to the curious observer, to contemplate the
variation of things. We know of nothing, either in the natural or
moral world, that continues in the same state: From a number of
instances that might be adduced, permit me to name one--that of
money. This, considered in the abstract, is of little or no value;
but, by the common consent of mankind, is erected into a general
arbitrator, to fix a value upon all others: a medium through which
every thing passes: a balance by which they must be weighed: a
touchstone to which they must be applied to find their worth:
though we can neither eat nor drink it, we can neither eat nor
drink without it.--He that has none best knows its use.</p>
<p>It has long been a complaint, that the same quantity of that
medium, money, will not produce so much of the necessaries of life,
particularly food, as heretofore; or, in other words, that
provisions have been gradually rising for many ages, and that the
milling, which formerly supported the laborious family a whole
week, will not now support it one day.</p>
<p>In times of remarkable scarcity, such as those in 1728, 41, 56,
66, and 74, the press abounded with publications on the subject;
but none, which I have seen, reached the question, though
short.</p>
<p>It is of no consequence, whether a bushel of corn sells for six
<i>pence</i>, or six <i>shillings</i>, but, what <i>time</i> a man
must labour before he can earn one?</p>
<p>If, by the moderate labour of thirty-six hours, in the reign of
Henry the Third, he could acquire a groat, which would purchase a
bushel of wheat; and if, in the reign of George the Third, he works
the same number of hours for eight shillings, which will make the
same purchase, the balance is exactly even. If, by our commercial
concerns with the eastern and the western worlds, the kingdom
abounds with bullion, money must be cheaper; therefore a larger
quantity is required to perform the same use. If money would go as
far now as in the days of Henry the Third, a journeyman in
Birmingham might amass a ministerial fortune.</p>
<p>Whether provisions abound more or less? And whether the poor
fare better or worse, in this period than in the other? are also
questions dependant upon trade, and therefore worth
investigating.</p>
<p>If the necessaries of life abound more in this reign, than in
that of Henry the Third, we cannot pronounce them dearer.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will not be absurd to suppose, that the same quantity
of land, directed by the superior hand of cultivation, in the
eighteenth century, will yield twice the produce, as by the
ignorant management of the thirteenth. We may suppose also, by the
vast number of new inclosures which have annually taken place since
the revolution, that twice the quantity of land is brought into
cultivation: It follows, that four times the quantity of provisions
is raised from the earth, than was raised under Henry the Third;
which will leave a large surplus in hand, after we have deducted
for additional luxury, a greater number of consumers, and also for
exportation.</p>
<p>This extraordinary stock is also a security against famine,
which our forefathers severely felt.</p>
<p>It will be granted, that in both periods the worst of the meat
was used by the poor. By the improvements in agriculture, the art
of feeding cattle is well understood, and much in practice; as the
land improves, so will the beast that feeds upon it: if the
productions, therefore, of the slaughter house, in this age,
surpass those of Henry the Third, then the fare of the poor is at
least as much superior now, as the worst of fat meat is superior to
the worst of lean.</p>
<p>The poor inhabitants in that day, found it difficult to procure
bread; but in this, they sometimes add cream and butter.</p>
<p>Thus it appears, that through the variation of things a balance
is preserved: That provisions have not advanced in price, but are
more plentiful: And that the lower class of men have found in
trade, that intricate, but beneficial clue, which guides them into
the confines of luxury.</p>
<p>Provisions and the manufactures, like a pair of scales, will not
preponderate together; but as weight is applied to the one, the
other will advance.</p>
<p>As labour is irksome to the body, a man will perform no more of
it than necessity obliges him; it follows, that in those times when
plenty preponderates, the manufactures tend to decay: For if a man
can support his family with three days labour, he will not work
six.</p>
<p>As the generality of men will perform no more work than produces
a maintenance, reduce that maintenance to half the price, and they
will perform but half the work: Hence half the commerce of a nation
is destroyed at one blow, and what is lost by one kingdom will be
recovered by another, in rivalship.</p>
<p>A commercial people, therefore, will endeavour to keep
provisions at a superior rate, yet within reach of the poor.</p>
<p>It follows also, that luxury is no way detrimental to trade; for
we frequently observe ability and industry exerted to support
it.</p>
<p>The practice of the Birmingham manufacturer, for, perhaps, a
hundred generations, was to keep within the warmth of his own
forge.</p>
<p>The foreign customer, therefore, applied to him for the
execution of orders, and regularly made his appearance twice a
year; and though this mode of business is not totally extinguished,
yet a very different one is adopted.</p>
<p>The merchant stands at the head of the manufacturer, purchases
his produce, and travels the whole island to promote the sale: A
practice that would have astonished our fore fathers. The
commercial spirit of the age, hath also penetrated beyond the
confines of Britain, and explored the whole continent of Europe;
nor does it stop there, for the West-Indies, and the American
world, are intimately acquainted with the Birmingham merchant; and
nothing but the exclusive command of the East-India Company, over
the Asiatic trade, prevents our riders from treading upon the heels
of each other, in the streets of Calcutta.</p>
<p>To this modern conduct of Birmingham, in sending her sons to the
foreign market, I ascribe the chief cause of her rapid
increase.</p>
<p>By the poor's books it appears, there are not three thousand
houses in Birmingham, that pay the parochial rates; whilst there
are more then five thousand that do not, chiefly through inability.
Hence we see what an amazing number of the laborious class of
mankind is among us. This valuable part of the creation, is the
prop of the remainder. They are the rise and support of our
commerce. From this fountain we draw our luxuries and our
pleasures. They spread our tables, and oil the wheels of our
carriages. They are also the riches and the defence of the
country.</p>
<p>How necessary then, is it to direct with prudence, the rough
passions of this important race, and make them subservient to the
great end of civil society. The deficiency of conduct in this
useful part of our species ought to be supplied by the
superior.</p>
<p>Let not the religious reader be surprised if I say, their
follies, and even their vices, under certain restrictions, are
beneficial. Corruption in the community, as well as in the natural
body, accelerates vital existence.</p>
<p>Let us survey one of the men, who begin life at the lowest ebb;
without property, or any other advantage but that of his own
prudence.</p>
<p>He comes, by length of time and very minute degrees, from being
directed himself, to have the direction of others. He quits the
precincts of servitude, and enters the dominions of command: He
laboured for others, but now others labour for him. Should the
whole race, therefore, possess the same prudence, they would all
become masters. Where then could be found the servant? Who is to
perform the manual part? Who to execute the orders of the merchant?
A world consisting only of masters, is like a monster consisting
only of a head. We know that the head is no more than the leading
power, the members are equally necessary. And, as one member is
placed in a more elevated state than another, so are the ranks of
men, that no void may be left. The hands and the feet, were
designed to execute the drudgery of life; the head for direction,
and all are suitable in their sphere.</p>
<p>If we turn the other side of the picture, we shall see a man
born in affluence, take the reins of direction; but like
Ph&aelig;ton, not being able to guide them, blunders on from
mischief to mischief, till he involves himself in destruction,
comes prone to the earth, and many are injured by his fall. From
directing the bridle, he submits to the bit; seeks for bread in the
shops, the line designed him by nature; where his hands become
callous with the file, and where, for the first time in his life,
he becomes useful to an injured society.</p>
<p>Thus, from imprudence, folly, and vice, is produced
poverty;--poverty produces labour; from labour, arise the
manufactures; and from these, the riches of a country, with all
their train of benefits.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to enumerate the great variety of trades
practised in Birmingham, neither would it give pleasure to the
reader. Some of them, spring up with the expedition of a blade of
grass, and, like that, wither in a summer. If some are lasting,
like the sun, others seem to change with the moon. Invention is
ever at work. Idleness; the manufactory of scandal, with the
numerous occupations connected with the cotton; the linen, the
silk, and the woollen trades, are little known among us.</p>
<p>Birmingham begun with the productions of the anvil, and probably
will end with them. The sons of the hammer, were once her chief
inhabitants; but that great croud of artists is now lost in a
greater: Genius seems to increase with multitude.</p>
<p>Part of the riches, extension, and improvement of Birmingham,
are owing to the late John Taylor, Esq; who possessed the singular
powers of perceiving things as they really were. The spring, and
consequence of action, were open to his view; whom we may justly
deem the Shakespear or the Newton of his day. He rose from minute
beginnings, to shine in the commercial hemisphere, as they in the
poetical and philosophical--Imitation is part of the human
character. An example of such eminence in himself, promoted
exertion in others; which, when prudence guided the helm, led on to
fortune: But the bold adventurer who crouded sail, without ballast
and without rudder, has been known to overset the vessel, and sink
insolvent.</p>
<p>To this uncommon genius we owe the gilt-button, the japanned and
gilt snuff-boxes, with the numerous race of enamels--From the same
fountain also issued the paper snuff-box, at which one servant
earned three pounds ten shillings per week, by painting them at a
farthing each.</p>
<p>In his shop were weekly manufactured buttons to the amount of
800<i>l</i> exclusive of other valuable productions.</p>
<p>One of the present nobility, of distinguished taste, examining
the works, with the master, purchased some of the articles, amongst
others, a toy of eighty guineas value, and, while paying for them,
observed with a smile, "he plainly saw he could not reside in
Birmingham for less than two hundred pounds a day."</p>
<p>The toy trades first made their appearance in Birmingham, in the
beginning of Charles the second, in an amazing variety, attended
with all their beauties and their graces. The first in pre-eminence
is</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="The_BUTTON."></a>The BUTTON.</h2>
<br>
<p>This beautiful ornament appears with infinite variation; and
though the original date is rather uncertain, yet we well remember
the long coats of our grandfathers covered with half a gross of
high-tops, and the cloaks of our grandmothers, ornamented with a
horn button nearly the size of a crown piece, a watch, or a John
apple, curiously wrought, as having passed through the Birmingham
press.</p>
<p>Though the common round button keeps on with the steady pace of
the day, yet we sometimes see the oval, the square, the pea, and
the pyramid, flash into existence. In some branches of traffic the
wearer calls loudly for new fashions; but in this, the fashions
tread upon each other, and crowd upon the wearer. The consumption
of this article is astonishing. There seem to be hidden treasures
couched within this magic circle, known only to a few, who extract
prodigious fortunes out of this useful toy, whilst a far greater
number, submit to a statute of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Trade, like a restive horse, can rarely be managed; for, where
one is carried to the end of a successful journey, many are thrown
off by the way. The next that calls our attention is</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="The_BUCKLE."></a>The BUCKLE.</h2>
<br>
<p>Perhaps the shoe, in one form or other, is nearly as ancient as
the foot. It originally appeared under the name of, sandal; this
was no other than a sole without an upper-leather. That fashion
hath since been inverted, and we now, sometimes, see an
upper-leather nearly without a sole. But, whatever was the cut of
the shoe, it always demanded a fastening. Under the house of
Plantagenet, it shot horizontally from the foot, like a Dutch
scait, to an enormous length, so that the extremity was fattened to
the knee, sometimes, with a silver chain, a silk lace, or even a
pack-thread string, rather than avoid <i>genteel taste</i>.</p>
<p>This thriving beak, drew the attention of the legislature, who
were determined to prune the exorbitant shoot. For in 1465 we find
an order of council, prohibiting the growth of the shoe toe, to
more than two inches, under the penalty of a dreadful curse from
the priest, and, which was worse, the payment of twenty shillings
to the king.</p>
<p>This fashion, like every other, gave way to time, and in its
stead, the rose began to bud upon the foot. Which under the house
of Tudor, opened in great perfection. No shoe was fashionable,
without being fattened with a full-blown rose. Under the house of
Stuart, the rose withered, which gave rise to the shoe-string.</p>
<p>The beaus of that age, ornamented their lower tier with double
laces of silk, tagged with silver, and the extremities beautified
with a small fringe of the same metal. The inferior class, wore
laces of plain silk, linen, or even a thong of leather; which last
is yet to be met with in the humble plains of rural life. But I am
inclined to think, the artists of Birmingham had no great hand in
fitting out the beau of the last century.</p>
<p>The revolution was remarkable, for the introduction of William,
of liberty, and the minute buckle; not differing much in size and
shape from the horse bean.</p>
<p>This offspring of fancy, like the clouds, is ever changing. The
fashion of to-day, is thrown into the casting pot to-morrow.</p>
<p>The buckle seems to have undergone every figure, size and shape
of geometrical invention: It has passed through every form in the
whole zodiac of Euclid. The large square buckle is the <i>ton</i>
of the present day. The ladies also, have adopted the reigning
taste: It is difficult to discover their beautiful little feet,
covered with an enormous shield of buckle; and we wonder to see the
active motion under the massive load. Thus the British fair support
the manufactures of Birmingham, and thus they kill by weight of
metal.</p>

<h2><a name="GUNS."></a>GUNS.</h2>
<br>
<p>Though the sword and the gun are equal companions in war, it
does not appear they are of equal original. I have already
observed, that the sword was the manufacture of Birmingham, in the
time of the Britons.</p>
<p>But tradition tells us, King William was once lamenting "That
guns were not manufactured in his dominions, but that he was
obliged to procure them from Holland at a great expence, and
greater difficulty."</p>
<p>One of the Members for Warwickshire being present, told the
King, "He thought his constituents could answer his Majesty's
wishes."--The King was pleased with the remark, and the Member
posted to Birmingham. Upon application to a person in Digbeth,
whose name I forget, the pattern was executed with precision,
which, when presented to the royal board, gave entire satisfaction.
Orders were immediately issued for large numbers, which have been
so frequently repeated that they never lost their road; and the
ingenious artists have been so amply rewarded, that they have
rolled in their carriages to this day.--Thus the same instrument
which is death to one man, is genteel life to another.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="LEATHER."></a>LEATHER.</h2>
<br>
<p>It may seem singular to a modern eye, to view this place in the
light of one vast tan-yard.--Though there is no appearance of that
necessary article among us, yet Birmingham was once a famous market
for leather. Digbeth not only abounded with tanners, but large
numbers of hides arrived weekly for sale, where the whole country
found a supply. When the weather would allow, they were ranged in
columns in the High-street, and at other times deposited in the
Leather-hall, at the East end of New-street, appropriated for their
reception.</p>
<p>This market was of great antiquity, perhaps not less than seven
hundred years, and continued till the beginning of the present
century. We have two officers, annually chosen, by the name of
<i>leather-sealers</i>, from a power given them by ancient charter,
to mark the vendible hides; but now the leather-sealers have no
duty, but that of taking an elegant dinner. Shops are erected upon
tan-fats; the Leather-hall is gone to destruction, and we are
reduced to one solitary tanner.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="STEEL."></a>STEEL.</h2>
<br>
<p>The progress of the arts, is equal to the progress of time; they
began, and will end together. Though some of both are lost, yet
they both accumulate.</p>
<p>The manufacture of iron, in Birmingham, is ancient beyond
research; that of steel is of modern date.</p>
<p>Pride is inseparable from the human character, the man without
it, is the man without breath: we trace it in various forms,
through every degree of people; but like those objects about us, it
is best discovered in our own sphere; those above, and those below
us, rather escape our notice; envy attacks an equal.</p>
<p>Pride induced the Pope to look with contempt on the European
Princes, and now induces them to return the compliment; it taught
insolence to the Spaniard, selfishness to the Dutch; it teaches the
rival nations of France and England to contend for power.</p>
<p>Pride preserves a man from mean actions, it throws him upon
meaner; it whets the sword for destruction; it urges the laudable
acts of humanity; it is the universal hinge on which we move; it
glides the gentle stream of usefulness, it overflows the mounds of
reason, and swells into a destructive flood; like the sun, in his
milder rays, it animates and draws us towards perfection; but, like
him, in his fiercer beams, it scorches and destroys.</p>
<p>Money is not the necessary attendant of pride, for it abounds no
where more than in the lowest ranks. It adds a sprucer air to a
sunday dress; casts a look of disdain from a bundle of rags; it
boasts the <i>honor</i> of a family, while poverty unites a sole
and upper-leather with a bandage of shop-thread. There are people
who even <i>pride</i> themselves in humility.</p>
<p>This dangerous <i>good</i>, this necessary <i>evil</i>, supports
the female character; without it, the brightest part of the
creation would degenerate.</p>
<p>It will be asked, "What portion may be allowed?" Prudence will
answer, "As much as you please, but <i>not</i> to disgust."</p>
<p>It is equally found in the senate-house, or the button-shop; the
scene of action is the scene of pride; and I, unable to adorn this
work with erudition, take a pride in cloathing a worn-out subject
afresh, and that pride will increase, should the world smi ----
"But why, says my friend, do you forsake the title of your chapter,
and lead us a dance through the mazes of pride? Can there be any
connexion between that sovereign passion, and forging a bar of
steel?" Yes, he who makes steel prides himself in carrying the art
one step higher than he who makes iron.</p>
<p>This art appeared among us in the seventeenth century; was
introduced by the family of Kettle. The name of Steelhouse-lane
will convey to posterity the situation of the works, the commercial
spirit of Birmingham, will convey the produce to the Antipodes.</p>
<p>From this warm, but dismal climate, issues the button, which
shines on the breast, and the bayonet, intended to pierce it; the
lancet, which bleeds the man, and the rowel, the horse; the lock,
which preserves the beloved bottle, and the screw, to uncork it;
the needle, equally obedient to the thimble and the pole.</p>

<h2><a name="NAILS."></a>NAILS.</h2>
<br>
<p>In most occupations, the profit of the master and the journeyman
bear a proportion: if the former is able to figure in genteel life,
the latter is able to figure in silk stockings. If the matter can
afford to allow upon his goods ten per cent. discount for money,
the servant can afford to squander half his wages. In a worn-down
trade, where the tides of profit are reduced to a low ebb, and
where imprudence sets her foot upon the premises, the matter and
the man starve together. Only <i>half</i> this is our present
case.</p>
<p>The art of nail-making is one of the most ancient among us; we
may safely charge its antiquity with four figures.</p>
<p>We cannot consider it a trade <i>in</i>, so much as <i>of</i>
Birmingham; for we have but few nail-makers left in the town: our
nailers are chiefly masters, and rather opulent. The manufacturers
are so scattered round the country, that we cannot travel far, in
any direction, out of the sound of the nail-hammer. But Birmingham,
like a powerful magnet, draws the produce of the anvil to
herself.</p>
<p>When I first approached her, from Walsall, in 1741, I was
surprized at the prodigious number of blacksmiths shops upon the
road; and could not conceive how a country, though populous, could
support so many people of the same occupation. In some of these
shops I observed one, or more females, stript of their upper
garment, and not overcharged with their lower, wielding the hammer
with all the grace of the sex. The beauties of their face were
rather eclipsed by the smut of the anvil; or, in poetical phrase,
the tincture of the forge had taken possession of those lips, which
might have been taken by the kiss.</p>
<p>Struck with the novelty, I inquired, "Whether the ladies in this
country shod horses?" but was answered, with a smile, "They are
nailers."</p>
<p>A fire without heat, a nailer of a fair complexion, or one who
despises the tankard, are equally rare among them. His whole system
of faith may be comprised in one article--That the slender
two-penny mug, used in a public house, <i>is deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked</i>.</p>
<p>While the master reaps the harvest of plenty, the workman
submits to the scanty gleanings of penury, a thin habit, an early
old age, and a figure bending towards the earth. Plenty comes not
near his dwelling, except of rags, and of children. But few
recruits arise from his nail-shop, except for the army. His hammer
is worn into deep hollows, fitting the fingers of a dark and plump
hand, hard as the timber it wears. His face, like the moon, is
often seen through a cloud.</p>

<h2><a name="BELLOWS."></a>BELLOWS.</h2>
<br>
<p>Man first catches the profession; the profession afterwards
moulds the man.</p>
<p>In whatever profession we engage, we assume its character,
become a part of it, vindicate its honor, its eminence, its
antiquity; or feel a wound through its sides.</p>
<p>Though there may be no more pride in a minister of state, who
opens a budget, than in a tinker who carries one, yet they equally
contend for the honor of their trade.</p>
<p>Every man, from the attorney's clerk to the butcher's
apprentice, feels his own honor, with that of his profession,
wounded by travelling on foot. To be caught on his feet, is nearly
the same as to be caught in a crime. The man who has gathered up
his limbs, and hung them on a horse, looks <i>down</i> with dignity
on him who has not; while the man on foot offers his humble bow,
afraid to look up--If providence favours us with feet, is it a
disgrace to use them?--I could instance a person who condescended
to quit London, that center of trick, lace, and equipage; and in
1761, open a draper's shop in Birmingham: but his feet, or his
<i>pride</i>, were so much hurt by walking, that he could scarcely
travel ten doors from his own without a post-chaise--the result
was, he became such an adept in riding, that in a few months, he
rode triumphant into the Gazette. Being quickly scoured bright by
the ill-judged laws of bankruptcy, he rode, for the last time,
<i>out</i> of Birmingham, where he had so often rode <i>in</i>: but
his injured creditors were obliged to <i>walk</i> after the slender
dividend of eighteen pence in the pound. The man who <i>can</i> use
his feet, is envied by him who <i>cannot</i>; and he, in turn,
envies him who <i>will</i> not. Our health and our feet, in a
double sense, go together. The human body has been justly compared
to a musical instrument; I add, this instrument was never perfectly
in tune, without a due portion of exercise.</p>
<p>The man of military character, puts on, with his scarlet, that
martial air, which tells us, "he has formed a resolution to kill:"
and we naturally ask, "Which sex?"</p>
<p>Some "<i>pert and affected author</i>" with anxiety on his brow,
will be apt to step forward, and say, "Will you celebrate the man
of the sword, who transfers the blush of his face to his back, and
neglect the man of the quill, who, like the pelican, portions out
his vitals to feed others? Which is preferable, he who lights up
the mental powers, or he who puts them out? the man who stores the
head with knowledge, or he who stores it with a bullet?"</p>
<p>The antiquarian supports his dignity with a solemn aspect; he
treats a sin and a smile as synonimous; one half of which has been
discarded from his childhood. If a smile in the house of religion,
or of mourning, be absurd, is there any reason to expel it from
those places where it is not? A tale will generally allow of two
ingredients, <i>information</i> and <i>amusement</i>: but the
historian and the antiquarian have, from time immemorial, used but
<i>one</i>. Every smile, except that of contempt, is beneficial to
the constitution; they tend to promote long life, and pleasure
while that life lasts. Much may be said in favour of tears of joy,
but more on joy without tears. I wonder the lively fancy of Hogarth
never sketched the <i>dull</i> historian, in the figure of an ass,
plodding to market under his panniers, laden with the fruits of
antiquity, and old time driving up the <i>rear</i>, with his scythe
converted into an hedge-stake.</p>
<p>The bellows-maker proclaims the <i>honor</i> of his art, by
observing, he alone produces that instrument which commands the
winds; his soft breeze, like that of the south, counter-acts the
chill blasts of winter: by his efforts, like those of the sun, the
world receives light: he creates when he pleases, and gives
<i>breath</i> when he creates. In his caverns the winds deep at
pleasure; and by his <i>orders</i> they set Europe in flames.</p>
<p>He pretends, that a gentle puff in the eyes of a
<i>reviewer</i>, from a pair of his bellows, would tend to clear
the sight, and enable him to distinguish between a smile and a
serious face: that his circular board, like a ferula, applied by
the handle to an inferior part, would induce him to peruse the
<i>whole treatise</i>, and not partially pronounce from the
preface.</p>
<p>He farther pretends, that the <i>antiquity</i> of his occupation
will appear from the plenty of elm, once in the neighbourhood, but
long cut up for his use: that the leather-market in Birmingham, for
many ages, furnished him with sides; and though the manufacture of
iron is allowed to be extremely ancient, yet the smith could not
procure his heat without a blast, nor could that blast be raised
without the bellows.</p>
<p>Two inferences arise from these remarks, that the antiquarian
will frown on this little history; and that bellows-making is one
of the oldest trades in Birmingham.</p>

<p>We, who reside in the interior parts of the kingdom, may observe
the first traces of a river issue from its fountain; the current so
extremely small, that if a bottle of liquor, distilled through the
urinary vessels, was discharged into its course, it would
manifestly augment the water, and quicken the stream: the reviving
bottle, having added spirits to the man, seems to add spirits to
the river.--If we pursue this river, winding through one hundred
and thirty miles, we shall observe it collect strength as it runs,
expand its borders, swell into consequence, employ multitudes of
people, carry wealth in its bosom, and exactly resemble
<i>thread-making</i> in Birmingham.</p>
<p>If we represent to our idea, a man able to employ three or four
people, himself in an apron, one of the number; but being
<i>unable</i> to write his name, shows his attachment to the
christian religion, by signing the <i>cross</i> to receipts; whose
method of book-keeping, like that of the publican, is <i>a door and
a lump of chalk;</i> producing a book which none can peruse but
himself: who, having manufactured 40lb. weight of thread, of divers
colours, and rammed it into a pair of leather bags, something
larger than a pair of boots, which we might deem the arms of his
trade <i>empaled</i>; flung them on a horse, and placed himself on
the top, by way of a <i>crest</i>; visits an adjacent market, to
starve with his goods at a stall, or retail them to the mercer, nor
return without the money--we shall see a thread-maker of 1652.</p>
<p>If we pursue this occupation, winding through the mazes of one
hundred and thirty <i>years</i>, we shall see it enlarge its
boundaries, multiply its people, increase its consequence and
wealth, till 1782, when we behold the matter in possession of
correct accounts, the apron thrown aside, the stall kicked over,
the bags tossed into the garret, and the mercer overlooked in the
grand prospect of exportation. We farther behold him take the lead
in provincial concerns, step into his own carriage, and hold the
king's commission as a magistrate.</p>

<h2><a name="PRINTING,"></a>PRINTING,</h2>
<h3>By JOHN BASKERVILLE.</h3>
<br>
<p>The pen of an historian rejoices in the actions of the great;
the fame of the deserving, like an oak tree, is of sluggish growth;
and, like the man himself, they are not matured in a day. The
present generation becomes debtor to him who excels, but the future
will discharge that debt with more than simple interest. The still
voice of fame may warble in his ears towards the close of life, but
her trumpet seldom sounds in full clarion, till those ears are
stopped with the finger of death.</p>
<p>This son of genius was born at Wolverley, in the county of
Worcester, in 1706; heir to a paternal estate of 60<i>l</i>. per
annum, which, fifty years after, while in his own possession, had
increased to 90<i>l</i>. He was trained to no occupation; but, in
1726, became a writing-matter in Birmingham.--In 1737, he taught
school in the Bull-ring, and is said to have written an excellent
hand.</p>
<p>As painting suited his talents, he entered into the lucrative
branch of japanning, and resided at No. 22, in Moor-street.</p>
<p>He took, in 1745, a building lease of eight acres, two furlongs
north west of the town, to which he gave the name of
<i>Easy-hill</i>, converted it into a little Eden, and built a
house in the center: but the town, as if conscious of his merit,
followed his retreat, and surrounded it with buildings.--Here he
continued the business of a japanner for life: his carriage, each
pannel of which was a distinct picture, might be considered <i>the
pattern-card of his trade</i>, and was drawn by a beautiful pair of
cream-coloured horses.</p>
<p>His inclination for letters induced him, in 1750, to turn his
thoughts towards the press. He spent many years in the uncertain
pursuit; sunk 600<i>l</i>. before he could produce one letter to
please himself, and some thousands before the shallow stream of
profit began to flow.</p>
<p>His first attempt, in 1756, was a quarto edition of Virgil,
price one guinea, now worth several.--He afterwards printed
Paradise Lost, the Bible, Common Prayer, Roman and English
Classics, etc. in various sizes, with more satisfaction to the
literary world than emolument to himself.</p>
<p>In 1765, he applied to his friend, Dr. Franklin, then at Paris,
and now Ambassador from America, to sound the literati, respecting
the purchase of his types; but received for answer, "That the
French, reduced by the war of 1756, were so far from pursuing
schemes of taste, that they were unable to repair their public
buildings, but suffered the scaffolding to rot before them."</p>
<p>In private life he was a humorist; idle in the extreme; but his
invention was of the true Birmingham model, active. He could well
design, but procured others to execute; wherever he found merit he
caressed it: he was remarkably polite to the stranger; fond of
show: a figure rather of the smaller size, and delighted to adorn
that figure with gold lace.--Although constructed with the light
timbers of a frigate, his movement was solemn as a ship of the
line.</p>
<p>During the twenty-five years I knew him, though in the decline
of life, he retained the singular traces of a handsome man. If he
exhibited a peevish temper, we may consider good-nature and intense
thinking are not always found together.</p>
<p>Taste accompanied him through the different walks of
agriculture, architecture, and the finer arts. Whatever passed
through his fingers, bore the lively marks of John Baskerville.</p>
<p>His aversion to christianity would not suffer him to lie among
christians; he therefore erected a mausoleum in his own grounds for
his remains, and died without issue, in 1775, at the age of
69.--Many efforts were used after his death, to dispose of the
types; but, to the lading discredit of the British nation, no
purchaser could be found in the whole commonwealth of letters. The
universities coldly rejected the offer. The London booksellers
understood no science like that of profit. The valuable property,
therefore, lay a dead weight, till purchased by a literary society
at Paris, in 1779, for 3700<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>It is an old remark, that no country abounds with genius so much
as this island; and it is a remark nearly as old, that genius is no
where so little rewarded; how else came Dryden, Goldsmith, and
Chatterton to want bread? Is merit, like a flower of the field, too
common to attract notice? or is the use of money beneath the care
of exalted talents?</p>
<p>Invention seldom pays the inventor. If you ask, what fortune
Baskerville ought to have been rewarded with? "The <i>most</i>
which can be comprised in five figures." If you farther ask, what
he possessed? "The <i>least</i>;" but none of it squeezed from the
press. What will the shade of this great man think, if capable of
thinking, that he has spent a fortune of opulence, and a life of
genius, in carrying to perfection the greatest of all human
inventions; and his productions, slighted by his country, were
hawked over Europe, in quest of a bidder?</p>
<p>We must <i>revere</i>, if we do not <i>imitate</i>, the taste
and economy of the French nation, who, brought by the British arms,
in 1762, to the verge of ruin, rising above distress, were able, in
17 years, to purchase Baskerville's elegant types, refused by his
own country, and expend an hundred thousand pounds in printing the
works of Voltaire!</p>

<br>
<p>Wherever the view of profit opens, the eyes of a Birmingham man
are open to see it.</p>
<p>In 1775, a person was determined to try if a Hackney Coach would
take with the inhabitants. He had not mounted the box many times
before he inadvertently dropped the expression, "Thirty shillings a
day!" The word was attended with all the powers of magic, for
instantly a second rolled into the circus.</p>
<p>And these elevated sons of the lash are now augmented to
fifteen, whom we may justly denominate a club of tippling deities,
who preside over weddings, christenings, and pleasurable
excursions.</p>
<p>It would give satisfaction to the curious calculator, could any
mode be found of discovering the returns of trade, made by the
united inhabitants. But the question is complicated. It only admits
of surmise. From comparing many instances in various ranks of life
among us, I have been led to suppose, that the weekly returns
exceed the annual rent of the buildings. And as these rents are
nearly ascertained, perhaps, we may conclude, that those returns
are about 80,000. If we deduct for four weeks holidays, the annual
returns will be--3,840,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Now we have entered the visionary regions of fancy, let us
pursue the thought a stage farther; and consider Birmingham as one
great family, possessed of a capital of Eight Millions. Her annual

<h2><a name="BANK."></a>BANK.</h2>
<br>
<p>Perhaps a public bank is as necessary to the health of the
commercial body, as exercise to the natural. The circulation of the
blood and spirits are promoted by one, so are cash and bills by the
other; and a stagnation is equally detrimental to both. Few places
are without: Yet Birmingham, famous in the annals of traffic, could
boast no such claim. To remedy this defect therefore, about every
tenth trader was a banker, or, a retailer of cash. At the head of
whom were marshalled the whole train of drapers and grocers, till
the year 1765, when a regular bank was established by Messrs.
Taylor and Lloyd, two opulent tradesmen, whose credit being equal
to that of the bank of England, quickly collected the shining rays
of sterling property into its focus.</p>

<h2><a name="GOVERNMENT."></a>GOVERNMENT.</h2>
<br>
<p>Have you, my dear reader, seen a sword hilt, of curious, and of
Birmingham manufactory, covered with spangles of various sizes,
every one of which carries a separate lustre, but, when united, has
a dazzling effect? Or, have you seen a ring, from the same origin,
set with diamonds of many dimensions, the least of which, sparkles
with amazing beauty, but, when beheld in cluster, surprize the
beholder? Or, have you, in a frosty evening, seen the heavens
bespangled with refulgent splendor, each stud shining with
intrinsic excellence, but, viewed in the aggregate, reflect honour
upon the maker, and enliven the hemisphere? Such is the British
government. Such is that excellent system of polity, which shines,
the envy of the stranger, and the protector of the native.</p>
<p>Every city, town and village in the English hemisphere, hath a
separate jurisdiction of its own, and may justly be deemed <i>a
stud in the grand lustre</i>.</p>
<p>Though the British Constitution is as far from perfection, as
the glory of the ring and the hilt is from that of the sun which
causes it, or the stars from the day; yet perhaps it stands higher
in the scale of excellence, than that of its neighbours. We may,
with propriety, allow that body to shine with splendor, which hath
been polishing for seventeen hundred years. Much honour is due to
the patriotic merit which advanced it to its present eminence.</p>
<p>Though Birmingham is but one sparkle of the brilliant clustre,
yet she is a sparkle of the first <i>water</i>, and of the first
<i>magnitude</i>.</p>
<p>The more perfect any system of government, the happier the
people. A wise government will punish for the commission of crimes,
but a wiser will endeavour to prevent them. Man is an active
animal: If he is not employed in some useful pursuit, he will
employ himself in mischief. Example is also prevalent: If one man
falls into error, he often draws another. Though heaven, for wise
purposes, suffers a people to fulfil the measure of their
iniquities, a prudent state will nip them in the bud.</p>
<p>It is easy to point out some places, only one third the
magnitude of Birmingham, whose frequent breaches of the law, and
quarrels among themselves, find employment for half a dozen
magistrates, and four times that number of constables; whilst the
business of this, was for many years conducted by a single Justice,
the late John Wyrley, Esq. If the reader should think I am mistaken
and object, that parish affairs cannot be conducted without a
second? Let me reply, He conducted that second also.</p>
<p>As human nature is nearly the same, whether in or out of
Birmingham; and as enormities seem more prevalent out than in, we
may reasonably ascribe the cause to the extraordinary industry of
the inhabitants, not allowing time to brood over, and bring forth
mischief, equal to places of inferior diligence.</p>
<p>We have at present two acting magistrates to hold the beam of
justice, the Rev. Benjamin Spencer, and Joseph Carles, Esq; who
both reside at a distance.</p>
<p>Many of our corporate towns received their charters from that
amiable, but unfortunate prince, Henry the Second. These were the
first dawnings of British liberty, after fixing the Norman yoke.
They were afterwards ratified and improved by the subsequent Kings
of England; granting not only the manors, but many exclusive
privileges. But at this day, those places which were so remarkably
favoured with the smiles of royalty, are not quite so free as those
that were not. The prosperity of this happy place proves the
assertion, of which every man is free the moment he enters.</p>
<p>We often behold a pompous corporation, which sounds well in
history, over something like a dirty village--This is a head
without a body. The very reverse is our case--We are a body without
a head. For though Birmingham has undergone an amazing alteration
in extension, riches and population, yet the government is nearly
the same as the Saxons left it. This part of my important history
therefore must suffer an eclipse: This illustrious chapter, that
rose in dazling brightness, must be veiled in the thick clouds of
obscurity: I shall figure with my corporation in a despicable
light. I am not able to bring upon the stage, a mayor and a group
of aldermen, dressed in antique scarlet, bordered with fur, drawing
a train of attendants; the meanest of which, even the pinder, is
badged with silver: Nor treat my guest with a band of music, in
scarlet cloaks with broad laces. I can grace the hand of my
Birmingham fidler with only a rusty instrument, and his back with
barely a whole coat; neither have I a mace for the inaugeration of
the chief magistrate. The reader, therefore, must either quit the
place, or be satisfied with such entertainment as the company
affords.</p>

<p>All which, the constables excepted, are no more than servants to
the lord of the manor; and whose duty extends no farther, than to
the preservation of the manorial rights.</p>
<p>The high bailiff is to inspect the market, and see that justice
takes place between buyer and seller; to rectify the weights and
dry measures used in the manor.</p>
<p>The low bailiff summons a jury, who choose all the other
officers, and generally with prudence. But the most important part
of his office is, to treat his friends at the expence of about
Seventy Pounds.</p>
<p>The headborough is only an assistant to the constables, chiefly
in time of absence.</p>
<p>High tasters examine the goodness of beer, and its measure.</p>
<p>Low tasters inspect the meat exposed to sale, and cause that to
be destroyed which is unfit for use.</p>
<p>Asseirers ratify the chief rent and amercements, between the
lord and the inhabitant. And the</p>
<p>Leather sealers, stamped a public seal upon the hides, when
Birmingham was a market for leather.</p>
<p>These manorial servants, instituted by ancient charter, chiefly
possess a name, without an office. Thus order seems assisted by
industry, and thus a numerous body of inhabitants are governed
without a governor.</p>
<p>Exclusive of the choice of officers, the jury impannelled by the
low bailiff, have the presentation of all encroachments upon the
lord's waste, which has long been neglected.</p>
<p>The duties of office are little known, except that of taking a
generous dinner, which is punctually observed. It is too early to
begin business till the table is well stored with bottles, and too
late afterwards.</p>
<p>During the existence of the house of Birmingham, the court-leet
was held at the Moat, in what we should now think a large and
shabby room, conducted under the eye of the low bailiff, at the
expence of the lord.</p>
<p>The jury, twice a year, were witnesses, that the famous dish of
roast beef, ancient as the family who gave it, demanded the head of
the table. The court was afterwards held at the Leather-hall, and
the expence, which was trifling, borne by the bailiff. Time,
prosperity, and emulation, are able to effect considerable changes.
The jury, in the beginning of the present century, were impannelled
in the Old Cross, then newly erected, from whence they adjourned to
the house of the bailiff, and were feasted at the growing charge of
<i>two or three pounds</i>.</p>
<p>This practice continued till about the year 1735, when the
company, grown too bulky for a private house, assembled at a
tavern, and the bailiff enjoyed the singular privilege of consuming
ten pounds upon his guests.</p>
<p>It is easier to advance in expences than to retreat. In 1760,
they had increased to forty pounds, and in the next edition of this
work, we may expect to see the word <i>hundred</i>.</p>
<p>The lord was anciently founder of the feast, and treated his
bailiff; but now that custom is inverted, and the bailiff treats
his lord.</p>
<p>The proclamation of our two fairs, is performed by the high
bailiff, in the name of the Lord of the Manor; this was done a
century ago, without the least expence. The strength of his liquor,
a silver tankard, and the pride of shewing it, perhaps induced him,
in process of time, to treat his attendants.</p>
<p>His ale, without a miracle, was, in a few years, converted into
wine, and that of various sorts; to which was added, a small
collation; and now his friends are complimented with a card, to
meet him at the Hotel, where he incurs an expence of twenty
pounds.</p>
<p>While the spirit of the people refines by intercourse, industry,
and the singular jurisdiction among us, this insignificant pimple,
on our head of government, swells into a wen.</p>
<p>Habits approved are soon acquired: a third entertainment has, of
late years, sprung up, termed <i>the constables feast</i>, with
this difference, <i>it is charged to the public</i>. We may
consider it a wart on the political body, which merits the
caustic.</p>
<p>Deritend, being a hamlet of Birmingham, sends her inhabitants to
the court-leet, where they perform suit and service, and where her
constable is chosen by the same jury.</p>
<p>I shall here exhibit a defective list of our principal officers
during the last century. If it should be objected, that a petty
constable is too insignificant, being the lowest officer of the
crown, for admission into history; I answer, by whatever
appellation an officer is accepted, he cannot be insignificant who
stands at the head of 50,000 people. Perhaps, therefore, the office
of constable may be sought for in future, and the officer himself
assume a superior consequence.</p>
<p>The dates are the years in which they were chosen, fixed by
charter, within thirty days after Michaelmas.</p>

<h2><a name="COURT_OF_REQUESTS."></a>COURT OF REQUESTS.</h2>
<br>
<p>Law is the very basis of civil society, without it man would
quickly return to his original rudeness; the result would be,
robbery and blood:--and even laws themselves are of little moment,
without a due execution of them--there is a necessity to annex
punishment.</p>
<p>But there is no necessity to punish the living, who are
innocent, by hanging the dead bodies of criminals in the air. This
indecent and inhuman custom, which originated from the days of
barbarism, reflects an indelible disgrace upon a civilized age. The
intention, no doubt, was laudable; to prevent the commission of
crimes, but does it answer that intention?</p>
<p>In 1759, two brothers, of the name of Darby, were hung in chains
near Hales-Owen, since which time there has been only one murder
committed in the whole neighbourhood, and that under the very
gibbet upon which they hung<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5">[5]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor5">[5]</a>
Joseph Skidmore, a carrier of Stourbridge, having Ann Mansfield, a
young woman of Birmingham, under his care, ravished and murdered
her in the evening of December 10, 1774.</blockquote>
<p>Justice, however, points out a way wherein the dead body, by
conveying chirurgical knowledge, may be serviceable to the
living.</p>
<p>Laws generally tend, either directly, or remotely, to the
protection of property.</p>
<p>All wise legislators have endeavoured to proportion the
punishment to the crime, but never to exceed it: a well conducted
state holds forth a scale of punishments for transgressions of
every dimension, beginning with the simple reprimand, and
proceeding downwards even to death itself.</p>
<p>It will be granted, that the line of equity ought to be drawn
with critical exactness.</p>
<p>If by fair trade, persuasion, or finesse, I get the property of
another into my hands, even to the trifling value of a shilling, my
effects ought to be responsible for that sum.</p>
<p>If I possess no effects, he certainly retains a right of
punishing to that amount: for if we do not lay this line in the
boundaries of strict justice, it will not lie upon any other
ground. And if I am allowed fraud in one shilling, I am allowed it
in a greater sum. How far punishment may be softened by concurring
circumstances, is another question.</p>
<p>It therefore follows of course, that if my creditor has a right
to recover his unfortunate property, those laws are the nearest to
perfection, that will enable him to recover it with the most
expedition, and the least expence and trouble to us both.</p>
<p>If the charge of recovery is likely to exceed the debt, he will
be apt to desist, I to laugh at him, and to try my skill at a
second enterprize.</p>
<p>Trade and credit cannot be well separated; they are as closely
connected as the wax and the paper. The laws of credit, therefore,
ought to rest upon a permanent foundation: neither is law necessary
to restrain credit; for if, in a commercial state, it becomes
detrimental by its over growth, it finds itself a remedy.</p>
<p>Much has been said, and perhaps more than has been thought,
concerning the court before us. The loser is expected to complain,
and his friends to give him a partial hearing; and though he
breathes <i>vengeance</i> against his antagonist, it ends in a
<i>breath</i>.</p>
<p>The looker-on can easily spy an error in the actor. If a fault
is committed, we are glad it was done by another; besides, it is no
new thing for the <i>outs</i> to complain of the <i>ins</i>. It
will plead strongly in excuse, to say, the intention was right, if
the judgment was wrong. If perfection is required, she does not
reside upon earth.</p>
<p>But if these pleadings are not found a balance against
prejudice, and a man suffers his wrath to kindle against a valuable
institution, because perfection does not preside over it, let him
peruse an old author, who asks, "What shall we think of the folly
of that man, who throws away the apple, because it contains a core?
despises the nut, for the shell? or casts the diamond into the sea,
because it has a flaw?"</p>
<p>Decision is usually established upon oath, both in criminal
courts, and in those at Westminster, through which the oath is seen
to pass with free currency.</p>
<p>A judge is sometimes fond of sheltering himself behind an oath;
it may be had at an easy rate. Each of the contending parties
wishes to win his cause by an oath: but though oaths would be
willingly taken, they ought to be sparingly given.--They may be
considered what they generally are not, <i>of the last
importance</i>.</p>
<p>We may observe, that two opponents are ready to swear directly
contrary to each other; that if a man asserts a thing, he can do no
less than swear it; and that, after all, an oath proves
nothing.</p>
<p>The commissioners, therefore, wish rather to establish
<i>fact</i> upon <i>proof</i>; but, if this is wanting, then upon
circumstantial evidence; and if this support fails, they chuse to
finish a quarrel by a moderate, though a random judgment.</p>
<p>Much honor is due to that judicial luminary, William Murray,
Earl of Mansfield, who presides over the King's-Bench, for
introducing equity into the courts of law, where she had long been
a stranger.</p>
<p>The Court of Requests may justly be charged with weakness, and
what court may not? It is inseparable from man.</p>
<p>A person cannot chuse his capacity, but he may chuse to be a
rogue; one is an act of nature, the other of the will. The greater
the temptation to go astray, the greater must be the resolution to
conquer it.</p>
<p>One of the suitors presented a commissioner with a couple of
chickens, as a powerful argument to strengthen a feeble case; but
the commissioner returned his present, and the plaintiff lost his
cause; and no wonder, he sent a chicken to plead it.</p>
<p>The defendant, by disobeying the orders of the court, falls
under the power of the plaintiff, who can cause execution to issue
against his goods, and reimburse himself; or, against his body, and
confine him forty days, unless paid his demand.</p>
<p>There is no cause that can be brought before the Court of
Requests, but may be brought before a higher court, and at a higher
expence.</p>
<p>A cause passes through this court for seventeen-pence; and
cannot well, by chicanery or neglect, amount to more than two
shillings and nine-pence: So that ruin is not one of its
imperfections.</p>
<p>Though law is said to produce quarrels among friends, yet the
contending parties often go out of that court better friends than
when they came in.</p>
<p>It has been objected, that the publicans give credit to the
lower class, in expectation of relief from the court. But the
debtor is equally apprized of the remedy, and often drinks deeper,
in expectation of a mild sentence from the commissioners; besides,
is not all credit founded on the laws of recovery?</p>
<p>It has also been urged, that while punishment pursues the
debtor, for neglect of orders, his family falls upon the
community.</p>
<p>But the community would not wish to put a bar between a man and
his property--The precedent would be dangerous: Justice is no
respector of persons. A culprit will soon procure a family, if they
are able to plead his excuse: It would follow, that single men only
would be obliged to be honest. She does not save the criminal,
because he is an handsome man. If she did, beauty would increase in
value; but honesty, seldom be its companion.</p>
<p>But can accusation lie against a fair tribunal of rectitude? The
man does not exist that can quarrel with equity, and treat her as
the offspring of fraud---The most amiable character in the
creation, and the immediate representative of supreme excellence.
She will be revered, even by the sons of plunder!</p>
<p>Many of the causes that pass this court, are of a disputable
nature, and if not terminated there, would take a different
turn.</p>
<p>From distant views of relief here, even sickness herself finds
credit in the day of distress.</p>
<p>The use of the court is also favourable to trade, for, to oblige
a man to pay his debts, is to oblige him to labour, which improves
the manufactures.</p>
<p>Birmingham, in no period of her existence, has increased with
such rapidity, in people, buildings and commerce, as since the
erection of that court; so that depopulation is not one of its
inconveniencies.</p>
<p>From a consideration of the prodigious intercourse subsisting in
so vast a body of people, and the credit consequent thereon, it was
wisely judged necessary to establish an easy, and expeditious
method of ending dispute, and securing property.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Birmingham, therefore, in 1752, procured an
act for the recovery of debts under Forty Shillings; constituting
seventy-two commissioners, three to be a quorum. They sit for the
dispatch of business in the chamber over the Old Cross every Friday
morning, and there usually appear before them between eighty and
one hundred causes: Their determinations are final. Two clerks
also, constituted by the act, attend the court to give judicial
assistance; are always of the law, chosen alternately by the lord
of the manor, and the commissioners, and to continue for life. Once
in every two years, ten of the commissioners are ballotted out, and
ten others of the inhabitants chosen in their stead.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="LAMP_ACT."></a>LAMP ACT.</h2>
<br>
<p>Order, is preserved by industry. In 1769 an act was obtained,
and in 1773 an amendment of the act, for lighting and cleaning the
streets of Birmingham, and for removing obstructions that were
prejudicial to the health or convenience of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>These acts were committed to the care of about seventy-six
irresolute commissioners, with farther powers of preventing
encroachments upon public ground; for it was justly observed, that
robbery was a work of darkness, therefore to introduce light would,
in some measure, protect property. That in a town like Birmingham,
full of commerce and inhabitants, where necessity leads to
continual action, no part of the twenty four hours ought to be
dark. That, to avoid darkness, is sometimes to avoid insult; and
that by the light of 700 lamps, many unfortunate accidents would be
prevented.</p>
<p>It was also observed, that in a course of time, the buildings in
some of the ancient streets had encroached upon the path, four or
five feet on each side; which caused an irregular line, and made
those streets eight or ten feet narrower, that are now used by
50,000 people, than they were, when used only by a tenth part of
that number; and, that their confined width rendered the passage
dangerous to children, women, and feeble age, particularly on the
market day and Saturday evening.</p>
<p>That if former encroachments could not be recovered, future
ought to be prevented.</p>
<p>And farther, that necessity pleads for a wider street now, than
heretofore, not only because the inhabitants, being more numerous,
require more room, but the buildings being more elevated, obstruct
the light, the sun, and the air, which obstructions tend to
sickness and inconveniency.</p>
<p>Narrow streets with modern buildings are generally dirty, for
want of these natural helps; as Digbeth, St. Martin's-lane,
Swan-alley, Carr's-lane, &amp;c. The narrower the street, the less
it can be influenced by the sun and the wind, consequently, the
more the dirt will abound; and by experimental observations upon
stagnate water in the street, it is found extremely prejudicial to
health. And also, the larger the number of people, the more
necessity to watch over their interest with a guardian eye.</p>
<p>It may farther be remarked, that an act of parliament ought to
distribute justice with an impartial hand, in which case, content
and obedience may reasonably be expected. But the acts before us
carry a manifest partiality, one man claims a right to an
encroachment into the street, of three or four feet, whilst another
is restricted to twelve inches.</p>
<p>This inactive body of seventy-six, who wisely argue against the
annihilation of one evil, because another will remain; had also
powers to borrow a thousand pounds, to purchase and remove some
obstructive buildings; and to defray the expence by a rate on the
inhabitants, which, after deducting about one hundred and twenty
pounds per ann. for deficiencies, amounted in</p>
<blockquote>1774, to&nbsp;&nbsp; 912<i>l</i>.<br>

<p>Though the town was averse to the measure, as an innovation,
they quickly saw its utility, and seemed to wish a more vigorous
exertion of the commissioners; but numbers sometimes procrastinate
design. If it is difficult to find five men of one mind, it is more
difficult to find a superior number. That business which would run
currently through the hands of five, stagnates at fifteen, the
number required.</p>
<p>It is curious to observe a body of commissioners, every one of
whom conducts his own private affairs with propriety and success,
attack a question by the hour, which is as plain as the simplest
proposition in the mathematicks, when not being able to reduce it,
and their ammunition spent, leave the matter undetermined, and
retreat in silence.</p>
<p>In works of manual operation a large number may be necessary,
but in works of direction a small one facilitates dispatch.</p>
<p>Birmingham, a capacious field, by long neglect is over-grown
with encroaching weeds. The gentle commissioners, appointed to
reduce them, behold it an arduous work, are divided in opinion, and
some withdraw the hand from the plough; certainly, <i>the harvest
is great, and the labourers are few</i>. The manorial powers, which
alone could preserve order, have slept for ages. Regularity has
been long extinct. The desire of trespass is so prevalent, that I
have been tempted to question; if it were not for the powers of the
lamp act, feeble as they are, whether the many-headed-public, ever
watchful of prey, would not in another century, devour whole
streets, and totally prevent the passenger. Thus a supine
jurisdiction abounds with <i>street-robbers</i>.</p>
<p>There are cases where the line of the street should inviolably
be preserved, as in a common range of houses; therefore all
projections above a given dimension infringe this rule.</p>
<p>There are other cases where taste would direct this line to be
broken, as in buildings of singular size and construction, which
should be viewed in recess. Those of a public nature generally come
under this description, as the free-school, and the hotel, which
ought to have fallen two or three yards back. What pity, that so
noble an edifice as the theatre in New-street, should lose any of
its beauty, by the prominence of its situation!</p>
<p>As Birmingham abounds with new streets, that were once private
property, it is a question often discussed, In what point of time
the land appropriated for such streets, ceases to be private? But
as this question was never determined, and as it naturally rises
before me, and is of importance, suffer me to examine it.</p>
<p>When building leases are granted, if the road be narrow, as was
lately the case at the West end of New-street, the proprietor
engages to give a certain portion of land to widen it. From that
moment, therefore, it falls to the lot of the public, and is under
the controul of the commissioners, as guardians of public property.
I allow, if within memory, the grantor and the lessees should agree
to cancel the leases, which is just as likely to happen as the
powers of attraction to cease, and the moon to descend from the
heavens; in this case, the land reverts again to its original
proprietor.</p>
<p>Though the streets of Birmingham have for many ages been exposed
to the hand of the encroacher, yet, by a little care, and less
expence, they might in about one century be reduced to a
considerable degree of use and beauty. In what light then shall we
be viewed by the future eye, if we neglect the interest of
posterity?</p>

<h2><a name="RELIGION_AND_POLITICS."></a>RELIGION AND
POLITICS.</h2>
<br>
<p>Although these two threads, like the warp and the woof, are very
distinct things; yet, like them, they are usually woven together.
Each possesses a strength of its own, but when united, have often
become extremely powerful, as in the case of Henry the Third and
the clergy. This union, at times, subsisted from a very early
date.</p>
<p>Power is the idol of man; we not only wish to acquire it, but
also to increase and preserve it. If the magistrate has been too
weak to execute his designs, he has backed his schemes with the aid
of the church; this occurred with King Stephen and the Bishops.</p>
<p>Likewise, if a churchman finds his power ascendant in the human
mind, he still wishes an addition to that power, by uniting
another. Thus the Bishop of Rome, being master of the spiritual
chair, stept also into the temporal.</p>
<p>Sometimes the ecclesiastical and civil governors appear in
malign aspect, or in modern phrase, like a quarrel between the
squire and the rector, which is seldom detrimental to the people.
This was the case with Henry the Eighth and the church.</p>
<p>The curses of a priest hath sometimes brought a people into
obedience to the King, when he was not able to bring them himself.
One could not refrain from smiling, to hear a Bishop curse the
people for obeying their Sovereign, and in a few months after,
curse them again if they did not; which happened in the reign of
King John. But, happy for the world, that these retail dealers in
the wrath of heaven are become extinct, and the market is over.</p>
<p>Birmingham, in those remote periods of time, does not seem to
have attended so much to religious and political dispute, as to the
course music of her hammer. Peace seems to have been her
characteristic--She paid obedience to that Prince had the good
fortune to possess the throne, and regularly paid divine honours in
St. Martin's, because there was no other church. Thus, through the
long ages of Saxon, Danish, and Norman government, we hear of no
noise but that of the anvil, till the reign of Henry the Third,
when her Lord joined the Barons against the Crown, and drew after
him some of his mechanics, to exercise the very arms they had been
taught to make; and where, at the battle of Evesham, he staked his
life and his fortune, and lost both.</p>
<p>Things quickly returning into their former channel, she stood a
silent spectator during that dreadful contest between the two
roses, pursuing the tenor of still life till the civil wars of
Charles I. when she took part with the Parliament, some of whose
troops were stationed here, particularly at the Garrison and
Camp-hill; the names of both originating in that circumstance.</p>
<p>Prince Rupert, as hinted before, approaching Birmingham in 1643
with a superior power, forced the lines, and as a punishment set
fire to the town. His vengeance burned fiercely in Bull-street, and
the affrighted inhabitants quenched the flames with a heavy
fine.</p>
<p>In 1660, she joined the wish of the kingdom, in the restoration
of the Stuart family. About this time, many of the curious
manufactures began to blossom in this prosperous garden of the
arts.</p>
<p>In 1688, when the nation chose to expel a race of Kings, though
replete with good nature, because they had forgot the limits of
justice ; our peaceable sons of art, wisely considering, that
oppression and commerce, like oil and water, could never unite,
smiled with the rest of the kingdom at the landing of the Prince of
Orange, and exerted their little assistance towards effecting the
Revolution, notwithstanding the lessons of <i>divine right</i> had
been taught near ninety years.</p>
<p>In the reign of Queen Anne, when that flaming luminary, Dr.
Sacheverel, set half the kingdom in blaze, the inhabitants of this
region of industry caught the spark of the day, and grew warm for
the church--They had always been inured to <i>fire</i>, but now we
behold them between <i>two</i>.</p>
<p>As the doctor rode in triumph through the streets of Birmingham,
this flimsy idol of party snuffed up the incense of the populace,
but the more sensible with held their homage; and when he preached
at Sutton Coldfield, where he had family connections, the people of
Birmingham crowded in multitudes round his pulpit. But it does not
appear that he taught his hearers to <i>build up Zion</i>, but
perhaps to pull her down; for they immediately went and gutted a
meeting-house.</p>
<p>It is easy to point out a time when it was dangerous to have
been of the established church, and I have here pointed out one,
when it was dangerous to profess any other.</p>
<p>We are apt to think the zeal of our fathers died with them, for
I have frequently beheld with pleasure, the churchman, the
presbyterian, and the quaker uniting their efforts, like brethren,
to carry on a work of utility. The bigot of the last age casts a
malicious sneer upon the religion of another, but the man of this
passes a joke upon his own.</p>
<p>A sameness in religious sentiment is no more to be expected,
than a sameness of face. If the human judgment varies in almost
every subject of plain knowledge, how can it be fixed in this,
composed of mystery?</p>
<p>As the true religion is ever that which a man professes himself,
it is necessary to enquire, What means, he that is right may use,
to convert him that is wrong?</p>
<p>As the whole generations of faggot and torture, are extinct in
this age of light, there seems only to remain fair arguments
founded in reason, and these can only be brought as evidences upon
the trial: The culprit himself, <i>by indefeasible right
divine</i>, will preside as the judge. Upon a close enquiry it will
be found, that his sentiments are as much his private property, as
the coat that covers him, or the life which that coat incloses.</p>
<p>Is there not as much reason to punish my neighbour for differing
in opinion from me, as to punish me, because I differ from him? Or,
is there any to punish either?</p>
<p>If a man's sentiments and practice in religious matters, appear
even absurd, provided society is not injured, what right hath the
magistrate to interfere?</p>
<p>The task is as easy to make the stream run upwards, as to form a
nation of one mind. We may pronounce with confidence, an age of
bigotry is no age of philosophy.</p>
<p>The gentle hand of Brunswick, had swayed the British sceptre
near half a century, ere all the sons of science in this meridian,
were compleatly reconciled to this favourite line.</p>
<p>But unanimity, with benign aspect, seems now the predominant
star of the zenith: A friendly intercourse succeeds suspicion. The
difference of sentiment, that once created jealousy, now excites a
smile; and the narrow views of our forefathers are prudently
expanded.</p>

<p>This, tho' joining to the parish of Birmingham, is a chapel of
ease belonging to Aston, two miles distant. Founded in the fifth of
Richard the Second, 1382.</p>
<p>This chapel does not, like others in Birmingham, seem to have
been erected first, and the houses brought round it: It appears, by
its extreme circumscribed latitude, to have been founded upon the
scite of other buildings, which were purchased, or rather given, by
Sir John de Birmingham, Lord of Deritend, and situated upon the
boundaries of the manor, perhaps to accommodate in some measure the
people of Digbeth; because the church in Birmingham must, for
many-ages, have been too small for the inhabitants.</p>
<p>Time seems to have worn out that building of 1382; in the
windows of which were the arms of Lord Dudley, and Dudley empaling
Barckley, both knights of the garter, descended from the Somery's,
Barons of Dudley-castle: Also a whole figure of Walter Arden, Esq;
of ancient family, often mentioned, Lord of Bordesley.</p>
<p>The present building was erected in 1735, and the steeple in
1762. In 1777 eight of the most musical bells, together with a
clock, entered the steeple. The present chaplain, the Rev. Thomas

of a considerable estate in and near Birmingham.</p>
<p>By the solicitation of Mrs. Weaman, Mrs. Jennens gave
1000<i>l</i>. and the remainder was raised by contribution to
accomplish the building.</p>
<p>Wherever a chapel is erected, the houses immediately, as if
touched by the wand of magic, spring into existence. Here is a
spacious area for interment, amply furnished by death. The infant
steeple, if it will bear the name, is very small but beautiful.</p>
<p>The chancel hath this singular difference from others--that it
veres towards the North. Whether the projector committed an error,
I leave to the critics.</p>
<p>It was the general practice of the Pagan church to fix their
altar, upon which they sacrificed, in the East, towards the rising
sun, the object of worship.</p>
<p>The Christian church, in the time of the Romans, immediately
succeeded the Pagan, and scrupulously adopted the same method;
which has been strictly adhered to.</p>
<p>By what obligation the Christian is bound to follow the Pagan,
or wherein a church would be injured by being directed to any of
the thirty-two points in the compass, is doubtful. Certain it is,
if the chancel of Bartholomew's had tended due East, the eye would
have been exceedingly hurt, and the builder would have raised an
object of ridicule for ages. The ground will admit of no situation
but that in which the church now stands. But the inconsiderate
architect of Deritend chapel, anxious to catch the Eastern point,
lost the line of the street: we may therefore justly pronounce,
<i>be sacrificed to the East</i>. Other enormities also, of little
moment, have issued from the same fountain.</p>

<p>St. Mary's, therefore, was erected in 1774, in the octagon form,

<br>
<p>Founded in Cannon-street, 1738. This hill of Zion is also hid
from the public eye, but situated in a purer air.--The minister was
the late Rev. James Turner.</p>
<p>Some trifling differences arising in the congregation, to which
the human mind is everlastingly prone, caused discontent:
Individuals began to sting each other, which in 1745, produced a
swarm.</p>
<p>The destitute wanderers therefore, erected for themselves a
small cell in Freeman-street, where they hived in expectation of
harmony. Over this little society of separatists presided a
journeyman woolcomber: What elevation he bore in the comb-shop,
during six days of the week, history is silent; but having the good
fortune to procure a black coat and a white wig, he figured on the
seventh with parsonic elegance.</p>
<p>Whether <i>he</i> fed his people best, or <i>they</i> him, is
uncertain; but whether they starved one another, is not. Disgust,
which ever waits upon disappointment, appeared among them.</p>
<p>Though the preacher was certainly warmed in the shop, <i>with a
live coal from the altar</i>; yet unfortunately, Sunday was the
only day in which his <i>fire</i> was extinguished; <i>then</i> the
priest and the people hit the taste of the day, and slumbered
together; a priviledge never granted by a <i>reader</i> to an
<i>author</i>. Thus the boasted <i>liberty of the press</i> submits
to that of the pulpit.</p>
<p>This exalted shepherd dwelt upon the words of Paul, <i>He that
preaches the gospel, ought to subsist by the gospel;</i> and
<i>they</i> did not forget a portion in John, <i>Feed my sheep</i>.
The word, he well knew, promised both wine and <i>oil</i>, but he
was obliged to be satisfied with the latter.</p>
<p>Although the teacher might possess some <i>shining qualities</i>
at the combe-pot, he did not possess that of protecting his flock,
who in 1752, silently retreated to their original fold in
Cannon-street; and the place was soon after converted into a
dwelling, No. 16, when for the first time it produced
<i>profit</i>.</p>
<p>The growing numbers of this prosperous society induced them, in
1780, to enlarge the place of worship, at the expence of about

<h2><a name="METHODIST's_MEETING."></a>METHODIST's MEETING.</h2>
<br>
<p>We learn from ecclesiastical history, that the people in high
life are always <i>followers</i> in religion. Though they are the
best leaders in political and social concerns, yet all religions
seem to originate from the lowest class. Every religion is first
obstructed by violence, passes through the insults of an age, then
rests in peace, and often takes up the rod against another.</p>
<p>The first preachers of the christian faith, the short-sighted
apostles, were men of the meanest occupations, and their church, a
wretched room in a miserable tenement. The superb buildings of St.
Peter's in Rome, and St. Paul's in London, used by their followers,
were not within the reach of their penetration. They were also
totally ignorant of tripple crowns, red hats, mitres, crosiers,
robes, and rochets, well known to their successors.</p>
<p>The religion of a private room, soon became the religion of a
country: the church acquired affluence, for all churches hate
poverty; and this humble church, disturbed for ages, became the
church of Rome, the disturber of Europe.</p>
<p>John Wickliff, in 1377, began to renew her disturbance: this
able theologist planted our present national church, which
underwent severe persecutions, from its mother church at Rome; but,
rising superior to the rod, and advancing to maturity, she became
the mother of a numerous offspring, which she afterwards persecuted
herself; and this offspring, like <i>their</i> mother, were much
inclined to persecution.</p>
<p>Puritanism, her first born, groaned under the pressure of her
hand. The Baptists, founded by a taylor, followed, and were
buffeted by both.--Independency appeared, ponderous as an elephant,
and trampled upon all three.</p>
<p>John Fox, a composition of the oddest matter, and of the meanest
original, formed a numerous band of disciples, who suffered the
insults of an age, but have carried the arts of prudence to the
highest pitch.</p>
<p>The Muglitonians, the Prophets, the Superlapsarians, &amp;c.
like untimely births, just saw the light and disappeared.</p>
<p>The Moravians, under the influence of Zinzendorf, rose about
1740, but are not in a flourishing state; their circumscribed
rules, like those of the cloister, being too much shackled to
thrive in a land of freedom.</p>
<p>James Sandiman introduced a religion, about 1750, but, though
eclipsed himself by poverty, he taught his preachers to shine; for
he allowed them to grace the pulpit with ruffles, lace, and a
cueque. Birmingham cannot produce one professor of the two last
churches.</p>
<p>The christian religion has branched into more sectaries in the
last two hundred years, than in the fifteen hundred before--the
reason is obvious. During the tedious reign of the Romish priest,
before the introduction of letters, knowledge was small, and he
wished to confine that knowledge to himself: he substituted mystery
for science, and led the people blindfold. But the printing-press,
though dark in itself, and surrounded with yet <i>darker</i>
materials, diffused a ray of light through the world, which enabled
every man to read, think, and judge for himself; hence diversity of
opinion, and the absurdity of reducing a nation to one faith,
vainly attempted by Henry VIII.</p>
<p>In those distant ages, the priest had great influence, with
little knowledge; but in these, great knowledge, with little
influence. He was then revered according to his authority; but now,
according to his merit: he shone in a borrowed, but now in a real
lustre: then he was less deserving; but now less esteemed. The
humble christian, in the strictest sense, worked out his salvation
with fear and trembling, and with tools furnished by the priest: he
built upon his opinions, but now he lays a foundation for his
own.</p>
<p>Though we acknowledge the scriptures our guide, we take the
liberty to guide them; we torture them to our own sentiments.
Though we allow their <i>equal</i> weight, we suffer one portion to
weigh down another. If we attend to twenty disputants, not one of
them will quote a text which militates against his sentiments.</p>
<p>The artillery of vengeance was pointed at Methodism for thirty
years; but, fixed as a rock, it could never be beaten down, and its
professors now enjoy their sentiments in quiet.</p>
<p>After the institution of this sect by George Whitfield, in 1738,
they were first covered by the heavens, equally exposed to the rain
and the rabble, and afterwards they occupied, for many years, a
place in Steelhouse-lane, where the wags of the age observed, "they
were eat out by the bugs."--They therefore procured a cast off
theatre in Moor-street, where they continued to exhibit till 1782;
when, quitting the stage, they erected a superb meeting-house, in
Cherry-street, at the expence of 1200<i>l</i>. This was opened,
July 7, by John Wesley, the chief priest, whose extensive
knowledge, and unblemished manners, give us a tolerable picture of
apostolic purity; who <i>believes</i>, as if he were to be saved by
faith; and who <i>labours</i>, as if he were to be saved by
works.</p>
<p>Thus our composite order of religion, an assemblage of the
Episcopalian, the Presbyterian, the Independent, and the Baptist;
fled from the buffetings of the vulgar, and now take peaceable
shelter from the dews of heaven.</p>

<h2><a name="ROMISH_CHAPEL."></a>ROMISH CHAPEL.</h2>
<br>
<p>I have already remarked, there is nothing which continues in the
same state: the code of manners, habits of thinking, and of
expression, modes of living, articles of learning; the ways of
acquiring wealth, or knowledge; our dress, diet, recreations,
&amp;c. change in every age.</p>
<p>But why is there a change in religion? eternal truth, once
fixed, is everlastingly the same. Religion is purity, which, one
would think, admits of no change; if it changes, we should doubt
whether it is religion. But a little attention to facts will inform
us, <i>there is nothing more changable:</i> nor need we wonder,
because, man himself being changable, every thing committed to his
care will change with him. We may plead his excuse, by observing,
his sight is defective: he may be deceived by viewing an object in
one light, or attitude, to-day, and another, to-morrow. This
propensity to change might lead us to suspect the authenticity of
our own sentiments.</p>
<p>The apostles certainly formed the church of Rome; but she,
having undergone the variations of seventeen hundred years, St.
Peter himself, should he return to the earth, could not discover
one linament in her aspect; but would be apt to reject her as a
changling.</p>
<p>The church of England has not only undergone a change since the
reformation, but wishes a greater.</p>
<p>We should suppose the puritan of 1583, and the dissenter of
1783, were the same: but although substance and shadow exactly
resemble each other, no two things differ more.</p>
<p>When pride sends a man in quest of a religion, if he does not
discover something new, he might as well stay at home: nothing near
the present standard can take. Two requisites are necessary to
found a religion, capacity, and singularity: no fool ever
succeeded. If his talents are not above mediocrity, he will not be
able to draw the crowd; and if his doctrines are not singular, the
crowd will not be drawn--novelty pleases.</p>
<p>Having collected, and brightened up a set of doctrines, wide of
every other church, he fixes at a distance from all. But time, and
unavoidable intercourse with the world, promote a nearer
approximation; and, mixing with men, we act like men. Thus the
Quaker under George III. shews but little of the Quaker under
George Fox.</p>
<p>In two congregations of the same profession, as in two twins of
the same family, though there is a striking likeness, the curious
observer will trace a considerable difference.</p>
<p>In a religion, as well as a man, <i>there is a time to be born,
and a time to die</i>. They both vary in aspect, according to the
length of their existence, carry the marks of decline, and sink
into obscurity.</p>
<p>We are well informed how much the Romish religion has declined
in this country: three hundred years ago Birmingham did not produce
one person of another persuasion; but now, out of 50,000 people, we
have not 300 of this.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics formerly enjoyed a place for religious
worship near St. Bartholomew's-chapel, still called Masshouse-lane;
but the rude hands of irreligion destroyed it. There is now none
nearer than Edgbaston, two miles distant; yet the congregation is
chiefly supplied from Birmingham.</p>
<p>If the Roman Catholics are not so powerful as in the sixteenth
century, they seem as quiet, and as little addicted to knowledge;
perhaps they have not yet learned to see through any eyes but those
of the priest.--There appears, however, as much devotion in their
public worship, as among any denomination of christians.</p>

<p>We have also among us a remnant of Israel. A people who, when
masters of their own country, were scarcely ever known to travel,
and who are now seldom employed in any thing else. But, though they
are ever moving, they are ever at home: who once lived the
favourites of heaven, and fed upon the cream of the earth; but now
are little regarded by either: whose society is entirely confined

<p>In the Synagogue, situated in the Froggery, they still preserve
the faint resemblence of the ancient worship. Their whole apparatus
being no more than the drooping ensigns of poverty. The place is
rather small, but tolerably filled; where there appears less
decorum than in the christian churches. The proverbial expression
"as rich as a jew," is not altogether verified in Birmingham, but
perhaps, time is transfering it to the Quakers.</p>
<p>It is rather singular, that the honesty of a jew, is seldom
pleaded but by the jew himself.</p>

<h2><a name="THEATRES."></a>THEATRES.</h2>
<br>
<p>The practice of the Theatre is of great antiquity. We find it in
great repute among the Greeks; we also find, the more a nation is
civilized, the more they have supported the stage. It seems
designed for two purposes, improvement and entertainment.</p>
<p>There are certain exuberances that naturally grow in religion,
government, and private life which may with propriety be attacked
by the poet and the comedian, but which can scarcely be reduced by
any other power. While the stage therefore keeps this great end in
view, it answers a valuable purpose to the community. The poet
should use his pen to reform, not to indulge a corrupt age, as was
the case in the days of Charles the Second, when indecency was
brought on to raise the laugh.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no period of time in which the stage was less
polluted, owing to the inimitable Garrick, than the present:
notwithstanding there is yet room for improvement.</p>
<p>Tragedy is to melt the heart, by exhibiting the unfortunate;
satiate revenge, by punishing the unjust tyrant: To discard vice,
and to keep undue passions within bounds.</p>
<p>Comedy holds up folly in a ridiculous light: Whatever conduct or
character is found in the regions of absurdity, furnishes proper
materials for the stage; and out of these, the pen of a master will
draw many useful lessons.</p>
<p>The pulpit and the stage have nearly the same use, but not in
the same line--That of improving the man.</p>
<p>The English stage opened about the conquest, and was wholly
confined to religion; in whose service it continued, with very
little intermission, to the extinction of the Plantagenets. The
play-houses were the churches, the principal actors the priests,
and the performances taken from scripture; such as the Fall of Man,
the Story of Joseph, Sampson, Histories of the Saints, the
Sufferings of Christ, Resurrection, Day of Judgment, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Theatrical exhibition in Birmingham, is rather of a modern date.
As far as memory can penetrate, the stroller occupied,
occasionally, a shed of boards in the fields, now Temple-street:
Here he acted the part of Distress, in a double capacity. The
situation was afterwards changed, but not the eminence, and the
Hinkleys dignified the performers booth!</p>
<p>In about 1730, the amusements of the stage rose in a superior
stile of elegance, and entered something like a stable in
Castle-street. Here the comedian strutted in painted rags,
ornamented with tinsel: The audience raised a noisy laugh, half
real and half forced, at three-pence a head.</p>
<p>In about 1740, a theatre was erected in Moor-street, which
rather gave a spring to the amusement; in the day time the comedian
beat up for volunteers for the night, delivered his bills of fare,
and roared out an encomium on the excellence of the entertainment,
which had not always the desired effect.</p>
<p>In 1751, a company arrived, which anounced themselves, "His
Majesty's servants, from the theatres-royal in London; and hoped
the public would excuse the ceremony of the drum, as beneath the
dignity of a London company." The novelty had a surprising effect;
the performers had merit; the house was continually crouded; the
general conversation turned upon theatrical exhibition, and the
town was converted into one vast theatre.</p>
<p>In 1752 it was found necessary to erect a larger theatre, that
in King Street, and we multiplied into two London companies.</p>
<p>The pulpits took the alarm, and in turn, roared after their
customers: But the pious teachers forgot it was only the fervour of
a day, which would cool of itself; that the fiercer the fire burns,
the sooner it will burn out.</p>
<p>This declaration of war, fortunately happening at the latter end
of summer, the campaign was over, and the company retreated into
winter quarters, without hostilities.</p>
<p>It was afterwards found, that two theatres were more than the
town chose to support; therefore that in Moor-street was set for a
methodist meeting, where, it was said, though it changed its
audience, it kept its primeval use, continuing the theatre of
farce.</p>
<p>In 1774, the theatre in King-street was enlarged, beautified,
and made more convenient; so that it hath very few equals.</p>
<p>About the same time that in New-street was erected upon a
suitable spot, an extensive plan, and richly ornamented with
paintings and scenery.--Expence seems the least object in
consideration.</p>
<p>An additional and superb portico, was erected in 1780, which
perhaps may cause it to be pronounced, "One of the first theatres
in Europe."</p>
<p>Two busts, in relief, of excellent workmanship, are elevated
over the attic windows; one is the father, and the other the
refiner of the British, stage--Shakespear and Garrick.</p>
<p>Also two figures eight feet high, are said to be under the
chissel, one of Thalia, and the other of Melpomene, the comic and
the tragic muses; the value one hundred and sixty guineas. Places
are reserved for their reception, to augment the beauty of the
front, and shew the taste of the age.</p>

<h2><a name="AMUSEMENTS."></a>AMUSEMENTS.</h2>
<br>
<p>Man seems formed for variety, whether we view him in a rational
or an animal light. A sameness of temper, habit, diet, pursuit, or
pleasure, is no part of his character. The different ages of his
life, also produce different sentiments; that which gives us the
highest relish in one period, is totally flat in another. The
rattle that pleases at three, would be cast into the fire at
threescore: The same hand that empties the purse at twenty, would
fill it at fifty: In age, he bends his knee to the same religion,
which he laughed at in youth: The prayer book, that holds the
attention of seventy, holds the lottery pictures of seven: And the
amorous tale that awakes the ideas of twenty five, lulls old age to
sleep.</p>
<p>Not only life is productive of change, but also every day in it.
If a man would take a minute survey of his thoughts and
employments, for only twenty-four hours, he would be astonished at
their infinite variety.</p>
<p>Though industry be the ruling passion of this ingenious race,
yet relaxation must follow, as one period to another. Society is
therefore justly esteemed an everlasting fund of amusement, which
is found at the tavern, in the winter evening: Intoxication is
seldom met with, except in the inferior ranks, where it is visible
in both sexes.</p>
<p>A regular concert is established, where the music is allowed to
excel. This harmonious science, like other productions of taste,
though it be not the general study of the inhabitants, hath made an
amazing progress during the last thirty years.</p>
<p>In 1777, a coffee-house was opened at the East end of
New-street, the first in this department; which, drawing into its
vortex the transactions of Europe, finds employment for the
politician.</p>
<p>Assemblies are held weekly, which give room for beauty to figure
at cards, in conversation, and in the dance.</p>
<p>The pleasures of the field claim their votaries, but, in a
populous country, like that of Birmingham, plenty of game is not to
be expected; for want of wild fowl, therefore, the shooter has been
sometimes known to attack the tame.</p>
<p>However, the farmer need not be under any great concern for his
property; the sportsman seldom does any thing with his
arms--but--<i>carry them</i>. We are more famous for <i>making</i>,
than <i>using</i> the gun.</p>
<p>A pack of hounds have sometimes been kept by subscription,
termed, The Birmingham Hunt; but, as the sound of the dogs and the
anvil never harmonised together, they have been long in disuse: the
jocund tribe, therefore, having no scent of their own, fall into
that of the neighbouring gentry, many of whom support a pack.</p>
<p>The man of reflection finds amusement in domestic resources;
and, in his own mind, if unoppressed. Here the treasures collected
from men, books, and observation, <i>are laid up for many
years</i>, from which he draws pleasure, without diminishing the
flock. The universal riches of nature and of art; the part, the
present, and a glympse of the future, lie open to his eye.</p>
<p>Two obstructions only bound his ideas, <i>time</i> and
<i>space</i>. He steps from planet to planet, and if he cannot
enter immensity, he can verge upon its borders.</p>
<p>I pity the man, who through poverty, cannot find warmth by his
own fire-side; but I pity him more, who, through poverty of
thought, cannot find happiness.</p>
<p>For the entertainment of summer, exclusive of the two theatres,
there are five greens, where the gentlemen are amused with bowls,
and the ladies with tea.</p>
<p>There are also great variety of public gardens, suited to every
class of people, or which Duddeston, the ancient seat of the Holte
family, claims the pre-eminence.</p>
<p>The fishing-rod, that instrument which <i>destroys in peace</i>,
must find a place: other animals are followed with fire and tumult,
but the fishes are entrapped with deceit. Of all the sportsmen, we
charge the angler alone with <i>killing in cold blood</i>.</p>
<p>Just as a pursuit abounds with pleasure, so will it abound with
votaries. The pleasure of angling depends on the success of the
line: this art is but little practised here, and less known. Our
rivers are small, and thinly stored; our pools are guarded as
private property: the Birmingham spirit is rather too active for
the sleepy amusement of fishing.</p>
<p>Patience seems the highest accomplishment of an angler. We
behold him, fixed as a statue, on the bank; his head inclining
towards the river, his attention upon the water, his eye upon the
float; he often draws, and draws only his hook! But although he
gets no bite, it may fairly be said <i>he is bit:</i> of the two,
the fish display the most cunning.--He, surprized that he has
<i>caught nothing</i>, and I, that he has kept his rod and his
patience.</p>
<p>Party excursion is held in considerable esteem, in which are
included Enville, the seat of Lord Stamford; Hagley, that of the
late Lord Lyttelton; and the Leasowes, the property of the late Wm.
Shenstone, Esq. We will omit the journey to London, a tour which
some of us have made all our lives <i>without seeing it</i>.</p>
<p>Cards and the visit are linked together, nor is the billiard
table totally forsaken. One man amuses himself in amassing a
fortune, and another in dissolving one.</p>
<p>About thirty-six of the inhabitants keep carriages for their own
private use; and near fifty have country houses. The relaxations of
the humbler class, are fives, quoits, skittles, and ale.</p>
<p>Health and amusement are found in the prodigious number of
private gardens scattered round Birmingham, from which we often
behold the father returning with a cabbage, and the daughter with a
nosegay.</p>

<h2><a name="HOTEL."></a>HOTEL.</h2>
<br>
<p>The spot where our great-grandmothers smiled in the lively
dance, when they possessed the flower of beauty in the spring of
life, is lost in forgetfulness. The floor that trembled under that
foot which was covered with a leather shoe tied with a silken
string, and which supported a stocking of dark blue worsted, not of
the finest texture, is now buried in oblivion.</p>

<b>Hotel.</b></p>
<br>
<p>In 1750 we had two assembly rooms; one at No. 11. in the Square,
the other No. 85. in Bull-street. This last was not much in use
afterwards. That in the Square continued in repute till in the
course of that evening which happened in October 1765, when Edward
Duke of York had the honour of leading up the dance, and the ladies
of Birmingham enjoyed that of the Duke's hand, He remarked, "That a
town of such magnitude as Birmingham, and adorned with so much
beauty, deserved a superior accomodation:--That the room itself was
mean, but the entrance still meaner."</p>
<p>Truth is ever the same, whether it comes from a prince or a
peasant; but its effects are not. Whether some secret charm
attended the Duke's expression, that blasted the room, is
uncertain, but it never after held its former eminence.</p>
<p>In 1772 a building was erected by subscription, upon the Tontine
principle, at the head of Temple row, and was dignified with the
French name of Hotel: From a handsome, entrance the ladies are now
led through a spacious saloon, at the extremity of which the eye is
struck with a grand flight of steps, opening into an assembly-room,
which would not disgrace even the royal presence of the Duke's
brother.</p>
<p>The pile itself is large, plain, and elegant, but standing in
the same line with the other buildings, which before were really
genteel, eclipses them by its superiority: Whereas, if the Hotel
had fallen a few feet back, it would, by breaking the line, have
preserved the beauty of the row, without losing its own.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="WAKES."></a>WAKES.</h2>
<br>
<p>This ancient custom was left us by the Saxons. Time, that makes
alteration only in other customs, has totally inverted this.</p>
<p>When a church was erected, it was immediately called after a
saint, put under his protection, and the day belonging to that
saint kept in the church as an high festival. In the evening
preceding the day, the inhabitants, with lights, approached the
church, and kept a continual devotion during the whole night; hence
the name <i>wake</i>: After which they entered into festivity.</p>
<p>But now the devotional part is forgot, the church is deserted,
and the festivity turned into riot, drunkenness, and mischief.</p>
<p>Without searching into the mouldy records of time, for evidence
to support our assertion, we may safely pronounce the wake the
lowest of all low amusements, and compleatly suited to the lowest
of tempers.</p>
<p>Wakes have been deemed a public concern, and legislature, more
than once, been obliged to interpose for the sake of that order
which private conduct could never boast.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry the Sixth, every consideration, whether of
a public or a private nature, gave way to the wake: The harvest in
particular was neglected. An order therefore issued, confining the
wakes to the first Sunday in October, consequently the whole nation
run mad at once.</p>
<p>Wakes in Birmingham are not ancient: Why St. Martin's, then the
only church, was neglected, is uncertain.</p>
<p>Although we have no wakes for the town, there are three kept in
its borders, called Deritend, Chapel, and Bell wakes. The two first
are in the spring of existence, the last in the falling leaf of
autumn.</p>
<p>Deritend wake probably took its rise at the erection of her
chapel, in 1382.</p>
<p>Chapel wake, in 1750, from St. Bartholomew's chapel, is held in
the meridian of Coleshill-street; was hatched and fostered by the
publicans, for the benefit of the spiggot.</p>
<p>Amongst other important amusements, was that of bull-baiting,
till the year 1773, when the commissioners of lamps, in the
amendment of their act, wisely broke the chain, and procured a
reprieve for the unfortunate animal.</p>
<p>Another was the horse-race, 'till a few years ago a person being
killed, rather slackened the entertainment. What singular genius
introduced the horse-race into a crowded street, I am yet to
learn.</p>
<p>In the evening the passenger cannot proceed without danger; in
the morning, he may discover which houses are public, without other
intelligence than the copious streams that have issued from the
wall. The blind may also distinguish the same thing, by the strong
scent of the tap.</p>
<p>Bell wake is the junior by one year, originating from the same
cause, in 1751, in consequence of ten bells being hung up in St
Philip's steeple.--'Till within these few years, we were at this
wake struck with a singular exhibition, that of a number of boys
running a race through the streets naked. Some of the inhabitants,
seeing so fair a mark for chastisement, applied the rod with
success, put a period to the sport, and obliged the young runners
to run under cover.</p>

<h2><a name="CLUBS."></a>CLUBS.</h2>
<br>
<p>It may be expected, from the title of this chapter, that I shall
introduce a set of ruffians armed with missive weapons; or, having
named a trump, a set of gamblers shuffling and dealing out the
cards: But whatever veneration I may entertain for these two fag
ends of our species, I shall certainly introduce a class of people,
which, though of the lower orders, are preferable to both.</p>
<p>Social compact is a distinguishing mark of civilization: The
whole British empire may be justly considered as one grand
alliance, united for public and private interest, and this vast
body of people are subdivided into an infinity of smaller
fraternities, for individual benefit.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are hundreds of these societies in Birmingham
under the name of clubs; some of them boast the antiquity of a
century, and by prudent direction have acquired a capital, at
accumulating interest. Thousands of the inhabitants are thus
connected, nay, to be otherwise is rather unfashionable, and some
are people of sentiment and property.</p>
<p>A variety of purposes are intended by these laudable
institutions, but the principal one is that of supporting the
sick.</p>
<p>Each society is governed by a code of laws of its own making,
which have at least the honour of <i>resembling</i> those of
legislature, for words without sense are found in both, and we
sometimes stumble upon contradiction.</p>
<p>The poor's-rates, enormous as they appear, are softened by these
brotherly aids. They tend also to keep the mind at rest, for a man
will enjoy the day of health, with double relish, when he considers
he has a treasure laid up for that of sickness.</p>
<p>If a <i>member</i> only of a poor family be sick, the
<i>head</i> still remains to procure necessaries; but if that head
be disordered, the whole source of supply is dried up, which
evinces the utility of such institutions.</p>
<p>The general custom is to meet at the public every fortnight,
spend a trifle, and each contribute six-pence, or any stated sum,
to the common stock. The landlord is always treasurer, or father,
and is assisted by two stewards, annually or monthly chosen.</p>
<p>As honour and low life are not always found together, we
sometimes see a man who is rather <i>idle</i>, wish the society may
suppose him <i>sick</i>, that he may rob them with more security.
Or, if a member hangs long upon the box, his brethren seek a
pretence to expel him. On the other hand, we frequently observe a
man silently retreat from the club, if another falls upon the box,
and fondly suppose himself no longer a member; or if the box be
loaded with sickness, the whole club has been known to dissolve,
that they may rid themselves of the burthen; but the Court of
Requests finds an easy remedy for these evils, and at a trifling
expence.</p>
<p>The charity of the club, is also extended beyond the grave, and
terminates with a present to the widow.</p>
<p>The philosophers tell us, "There is no good without its kindred
evil." This amiable body of men, therefore, marshalled to expel
disease, hath one small alloy, and perhaps but one. As liquor and
labour are inseparable, the imprudent member is apt to forget to
quit the club room when he has spent his necessary two-pence, but
continues there to the injury of his family.</p>
<p>Another of these institutions is the <i>rent club</i>, where,
from the weekly sums deposited by the members, a sop is regularly
served up twice a year, to prevent the growlings of a landlord.</p>
<p>In the <i>breeches club</i> every member ballots for a pair,
value a guinea, <i>promised</i> of more value by the maker. This
club dissolves when all the members are served.</p>
<p>The intentions of the <i>book club</i> are well known, to catch
the productions of the press as they rise.</p>
<p>The <i>watch club</i> has generally a watchmaker for its
president, is composed of young men, and is always temporary.</p>
<p>If a taylor be short of employment, he has only to consult a
landlord over a bottle, who, by their joint powers, can give birth
to a <i>cloaths club</i>; where every member is supplied with a
suit to his taste, of a stipulated price. These are chiefly
composed of batchelors, who wish to shine in the eye of the
fair.</p>
<p>Thus a bricklayer stands at the head of the <i>building
club</i>, where every member perhaps subscribes two guineas per
month, and each house, value about one hundred pounds, is balloted
for, as soon as erected. As a house is a weighty concern, every
member is obliged to produce two bondsmen for the performance of
covenants.</p>
<p>I will venture to pronounce another the <i>capital club</i>, for
when the contributions amount to 50<i>l</i>. the members ballot for
this capital, to bring into business: Here also securities are
necessary. It is easy to conceive the two last clubs are extremely
beneficial to building and to commerce.</p>
<p>The last I shall enumerate is the <i>clock club</i>: When the
weekly deposits of the members amount to about 4<i>l</i>. they call
lots who shall be first served with a clock of that value, and
continue the same method till the whole club is supplied; after
which, the clockmaker and landlord cast about for another set, who
are chiefly composed of young house-keepers. Hence the beginner
ornaments his premises with furniture, the artist finds employment
and profit, and the publican empties his barrel.</p>
<p>Thus we have taken a transient survey of this rising colony of
arts, uniting observation with fact: We have seen her dark
manufactures, in darker times: We have attended her through her
commercial, religious, political, and pleasurable walks: Have
viewed her in many points of light, but never in decline; 'till we
have now set her in the fair sunshine of the present day.</p>
<p>Perhaps I shall not be charged with prolixity, that unpardonable
sin against the reader, when it is considered, that three thousand
years are deposited in the compass of one hundred and forty little
pages.</p>
<p>Some other circumstances deserve attention, which could not be
introduced without breaking the thread of history: But as that
thread is now drawn to an end, I must, before I resume it, step
back into the recesses of time, and slumber through the long ages
of seventeen hundred years; if the active reader, therefore, has no
inclination for a nod of that length, or, in simple phrase, no
relish for antiquity, I advise him to pass over the five ensuing
chapters.</p>

<h2><a name="IKENIELD_STREET."></a>IKENIELD STREET.</h2>
<br>
<p>About five furlongs North of the Navigation Bridge, in Great
Charles street, which is the boundary of the present buildings,
runs the Ikenield-street; one of those famous pretorian roads which
mark the Romans with conquest, and the Britons with slavery.</p>
<p>By that time a century had elapsed, from the first landing of
Caesar in Britain the victorious Romans had carried their arms
through the southern part of the isle. They therefore endeavoured
to secure the conquered provinces by opening four roads, which
should each rise in the shore, communicate with, and cross each
other, form different angles, extend over the island several ways,
and terminate in the opposite sea.</p>
<p>These are the Watling-street, which rises near Dover, and
running North-west through London, Atherstone, and Shropshire, in
the neighbourhood of Chester, ends in the Irish sea.</p>
<p>The Foss begins in Devonshlre, extends South-east through
Leicestershire, continuing its course through Lincolnshire, to the
verge of the German ocean.</p>
<p>These two roads, crossing each other at right angles, form a
figure resembling the letter X, whose centre is the High Cross,
which divides the counties of Warwick and Leicester.</p>
<p>The Ermine-street extends along the southern part of the island;
near the British channel; and the Ikenield-street, which I cannot
so soon quit, rises near Southampton, extends nearly North, through
Winchester, Wallingford, and over the Isis, at New-bridge; thence
to Burford, crossing the Foss at Stow in the Woulds, over
Bitford-bridge, in the County of Warwick, to Alcester; by Studley,
Ipsley, Beely, Wetherick-hill, Stutley-street; crosses the road
from Birmingham to Bromsgrove, at Selley oak, leaving Harborne a
mile to the left, also the Hales Owen road a mile West of
Birmingham: Thence by the Observatory in Lady-wood-lane, where it
enters the parish of Birmingham, crossing the Dudley road at the
Sand-pits; along Worstone-lane; through the little pool, and
Hockley-brook, where it quits the parish: Thence over
Handsworth-heath, entering a little lane on the right of
Bristle-lands-end, and over the river Tame, at Offord-mill,
(Oldford-mill) directly to Sutton Coldfield. It passes the Ridgeway
a few yards East of King's-standing, a little artificial mount, on
which Charles the First is said to have stood when he harangued the
troops he brought out of Shropshire, at the opening of the civil
wars, in 1642. From thence the road proceeds through Sutton park,
and the remainder of the Coldfield; over Radley-moor; from thence
to Wall, a Roman station, where it meets the Watling-street:
Leaving Lichfield a mile to the left, it leads through Street-hay;
over Fradley-heath; thence through Alderwas hays, crossing the
river Trent, at Wichnor-bridge, to Branson-turnpike: over
Burton-moor, leaving the town half a mile to the right: thence to
Monk's-bridge, upon the river Dove; along Egington-heath,
Little-over, the Rue-dyches, Stepping-lane, Nun-green, and
Darley-slade, to the river Derwent, one mile above Derby; upon the
eastern banks of which stands Little Chester, built by the
Romans.</p>
<p>If the traveller is tired with this tedious journey, and dull
description, which admits of no variety, we will stop for a moment,
and refresh in this Roman city.</p>
<p>In drawing the flewks of his oar along the bed of the river, as
he boats over it, he may feel the foundations of a Roman bridge,
nearly level with its bottom. Joining the water are the vestiges of
a castle, now an orchard. Roman coins are frequently discovered--In
1765, I was presented with one of Vespasian's, found the year
before in scowering a ditch; but I am sorry to observe, it has
suffered more during the fifteen years in my possession, than
during the fifteen hundred it lay in the earth.</p>
<p>The inhabitants being in want of materials to form a turnpike
road, attempted to pull up this renowned military way, for the sake
of those materials, but found them too strongly cemented to admit
of an easy separation, and therefore desisted when they had taken
up a few loads.</p>
<p>I saw the section of this road cut up from the bottom: the
Romans seem to have formed it with infinite labour and expence.
They took out the soil for about twenty yards wide, and one deep,
perhaps, till they came to a firm bottom; and filled up the whole
with stones of all sizes, brought from Duffield, four miles up the
river; cemented with coarse mortar.</p>
<p>The road here is only discoverable by its barren track, along
the cultivated meadows. It then proceeds over Morley-moor, through
Scarsdale, by Chesterfield, Balsover, through Yorkshire,
Northumberland, and terminates upon the banks of the Tine, near
Tinmouth.</p>
<p>There are many roads in England formed by the Romans: they were
of two kinds, the military, which crossed the island; and the
smaller, which extended from one town to another. The four I have
mentioned come under the first class: they rather avoided, than led
through a town, that they might not be injured by traffic.</p>
<p>Two of these four, the Watling-street, and the Ikenield-street,
are thought, by their names, to be British, and with some reason;
neither of the words are derived from the Latin: but whatever were
their origin, they are certainly of Roman construction.</p>
<p>These great roads were begun as soon as the island was subdued,
to employ the military, and awe the natives, and were divided into
stages, at the end of each was a fort, or station, to accommodate
the guard, for the reception of stores, the conveniency of marching
parties, and to prevent the soldiers from mixing with the
Britons.</p>
<p>The stations upon the Ikenield-street, in our neighbourhood, are
Little Chester (Derventione) a square fort, nearly half an acre;
joining the road to the south, and the Derwent to the west.</p>
<p>The next is Burton upon Trent (Ad Trivonam) thirteen miles
south. Here I find no remains of a station.</p>
<p>Then Wall (Etocetum) near Lichfield, which I have examined with
great labour, or rather with great pleasure: Here the two famous
consular roads cross each other. We should expect a fort in the
angle, commanding both, which is not the case. The Watling-street
is lost for about half a mile, leading over a morass, only the line
is faintly preserved, by a blind path over the inclosures: the
Ikenield-street crosses it in this morass, not the least traces of
which remain. But, by a strict attention, I could point out their
junction to a few yards.</p>
<p>Six furlongs west of this junction, and one hundred yards north
of the Watling-street, in a close, now about three acres, are the
remains of the Roman fortress. This building, of strength and
terror, is reduced to one piece of thick wall, visibly of Roman
workmanship, from whence the place derives its modern name.</p>
<p>Can you, says I to a senior peasant, for I love to appeal to old
age, tell the origin of that building?</p>
<p>"No; but we suppose it has been a church. The ruins were much
larger in my memory; but they were lately destroyed, to bring the
land into that improved state of cultivation in which you see
it."--And so you reduced a fortress in four years, which the
Britons never could in four hundred. For a trifling profit, you
eraze the work of the ancients, and prevent the wonder of the
moderns.--Are you apprised of any old walls under the surface?</p>
<p>"Yes; the close is full of them: I have broke three ploughs in
one day; no tool will stand against them. It has been more
expensive to bring the land into its present condition, than the
freehold is worth." Why, you seem more willing to destroy than your
tools; and more able than time. The works which were the admiration
of ages, you bury under ground. What the traveller comes many miles
to see, you assiduously hide.</p>
<p>What could be the meaning that the Romans erected their station
on the declivity of this hill, when the summit, two hundred yards
distant, is much more eligible; are there no foundations upon it?
"None."</p>
<p>The commandry is preferable: the Watling-street runs by it, and
it is nearer the Ikenield-street. Pray, are you acquainted with
another Roman road which crosses it? "No."</p>
<p>Do you know any close about the village, where a narrow bed of
gravel, which runs a considerable length, has impeded the
plough?</p>
<p>"Yes; there is a place, half a mile distant, where, when a
child, I drove the plough; we penetrated a land of gravel, and my
companion's grandfather told us, it had been an old road."--That is
the place I want, lead me to it. Being already master of both ends
of the road, like a broken line, with the center worn out, the
gravel bed enabled me to recover it.</p>
<p>The next station upon the Ikenield-street is Birmingham
(Bremenium) I have examined this country with care; but find no
vestiges of a station: nor shall we wonder; dissolation is the
preserver of antiquity, nothing of which reigns here; the most
likely place is Wor-ston (Wall-stone) which a younger brother of
Birmingham might afterwards convert into the fashionable moat of
the times, and erect a castle. The next station is Alcester
(Alauna) all which are nearly at equal distances.</p>
<p>In forming these grand roads, a strait direction seems to have
been their leading maxim. Though curiosity has lead me to travel
many hundred miles upon their roads, with the eye of an enquirer, I
cannot recollect one instance, where they ever broke the line to
avoid a hill, a swamp, a rock, or a river.</p>
<p>They were well acquainted with the propriety of an old English
adage, <i>Once well done is twice done</i>; an idea new cloathed by
Lord Chesterfield, <i>If a a thing be worth doing at all, it is
worth doing well</i>.</p>
<p>For their roads were so durably constructed, that, had they been
appropriated only to the use intended, they might have withstood
the efforts of time, and bid fair for eternity.--Why is this useful
art so lost among the moderns?</p>
<p>When time and intercourse had so far united the Romans and the
Britons, that they approached nearly to one people, the Romans
formed, or rather <i>improved</i>, many of the smaller roads;
placed stones of intelligence upon them; hence, London Stone, Stony
Stratford (the stone at the Street-ford) Atherstone, stone (hither,
near, or first stone from Witherly-bridge, a Roman camp) and fixed
their stations in the places to which these roads tended.</p>
<p>The great roads, as observed before, were chiefly appropriated
for military purposes, and instituted in the beginning of their
government; but the smaller were of later date, and designed for
common use. As these came more in practice, there was less occasion
for the military; which, not leading to their towns, were, in
process of time, nearly laid aside.</p>
<p>Antonine, and his numerous train of commentators, have not
bestowed that attention on the roads they deserve: a curious
acquaintance with the roads of a country, brings us acquainted with
the manners of the people: in one, like a mirror, is exactly
represented the other. Their state, like a master key, unlocks many
apartments.</p>
<p>The authors I have seen are <i>all in the wrong</i>; and as my
researches are confined, it is a mortification, I am not able to
set them right. They have confounded the two classes together,
which were very distinct in chronology, the manner of making, and
their use. If an author treats of one old road, he supposes himself
bound to treat of all in the kingdom, a task no man can execute: by
undertaking much, we do nothing well; the journey of an antiquarian
mould never be rapid. If fortune offers a small discovery, let him
think, and compare. Neither will they ever be set right, but
continue to build a mouldering fabric, with untempered mortar, till
a number of intelligent residents, by local enquiries can produce
solid materials for a lasting monument.</p>
<p>The Romans properly termed their ways streets, a name retained
by many of them to this day; one of the smaller roads, issuing from
London, penetrates through Stratford upon Avon (Street-ford)
Monks-path-street, and Shirley-street, to Birmingham, which proves
it of great antiquity, and the Ikenield-street running by it,
proves it of greater. We may from hence safely conclude, Birmingham
was a place of note in the time of Caesar, because she merited
legislative regard in forming their roads; which will send us far
back among the Britons, to find her first existence.</p>
<p>Though we are certain the Ikenield-street passes about a mile in
length through this parish, as described above; yet, as there are
no Roman traces to be seen, I must take the curious traveller to
that vast waste, called Sutton-Coldfield, about four miles distant,
where he will, in the same road, find the footsteps of those great
mailers of the world, marked in lasting characters.</p>
<p>He will plainly see its straight line pass over the Ridgeway,
through Sutton Park, leaving the West hedge about 200 yards to the
left; through the remainder of the Coldfield, till lost in
cultivation.</p>
<p>This track is more than three miles in length, and is no where
else visible in these parts. I must apprize him that its highest
beauty is only discovered by an horizontal sun in the winter
months.</p>
<p>I first saw it in 1762, relieved by the transverse rays, in a
clear evening in November; I had a perfect view upon the Ridgeway,
near King's-standing of this delightful scene: Had I been attacked
by the chill blasts of winter, upon this bleak mountain, the
sensation would have been lost in the transport. The eye, at one
view, takes in more than two miles. Struck with astonishment, I
thought it the grandest sight I had ever beheld; and was amazed, so
noble a monument of antiquity should be so little regarded.</p>
<p>The poets have long contended for the line of beauty--they may
find it here. I was fixed as by enchantment till the sun dropt, my
prospect with it, and I left the place with regret.</p>
<p>If the industrious traveller chooses to wade up to the middle in
gorse, as I did, he may find a roughish journey along this famous
military way.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the only road in which money is of no use to the
traveller; for upon this barren wild he can neither spend it, nor
give it away.</p>
<p>He will perceive the Coldfield to be one vast bed of gravel,
covered with a moderate depth of soil of eight or ten inches:
During this journey of three miles, he will observe all the way, on
each side, a number of pits, perhaps more than a thousand, out of
which the Romans procured the gravel to form the road; none of them
many yards from it. This great number of pits, tends to prove two
points--That the country was full of timber, which they not
choosing to fall, procured the gravel in the interstices; for the
road is composed of nothing else--And, that a great number of
people were employed in its formation: They would also, with the
trees properly disposed, which the Romans must inevitably cut to
procure a passage, form a barrier to the road.</p>
<p>This noble production was designed by a master, is every where
straight, and executed with labour and judgement.</p>
<p>Here he perceives the date of his own conquest, and of his
civilization. Thus the Romans humbled a ferocious people.</p>
<p>If he chooses to measure it he will find it exactly sixty feet
wide, divided into three lands, resembling those in a ploughed
field. The centre land thirty-six feet, and raised from one to
three, according to the nature of the ground. The side lands,
twelve each, and rising seldom more than one foot.</p>
<p>This centre land no doubt was appropriated for the march of the
troops, and the small one, on each side, for the out-guards, who
preserved their ranks, for fear of a surprize from the vigilant and
angry Britons.</p>
<p>The Romans held these roads in great esteem, and were severe in
their laws for their preservation.</p>
<p>This famous road is visible all the way, but in some parts
greatly hurt, and in others, compleat as in the first day the
Romans made it. Perhaps the inquisitive traveller may find here,
the only monument in the whole island left us by the Romans, that
<i>time</i> hath not injured.</p>
<p>The philosophical traveller may make some curious observations
in the line of agriculture, yet in its infancy.</p>
<p>The only growth upon this wild, is gorse and ling: The
vegetation upon the road and the adjacent lands, seem equal: The
pits are all covered with a tolerable turf.</p>
<p>As this road has been made about 1720 years, and, as at the time
of making, both that and the pits must have been surfaces of neat
gravel; he will be led to examine, what degree of soil they have
acquired in that long course of years, and by what means?</p>
<p>He well knows, that the surface of the earth is very far from
being a fixed body: That there is a continual motion in every part,
stone excepted: That the operations of the sun, the air, the frost,
the dews, the winds, and the rain, produce a constant agitation,
which changes the particles and the pores, tends to promote
vegetation, and to increase the soil to a certain depth.</p>
<p>This progress is too minute for the human eye, but the effects
are visible. The powers above mentioned operate nearly as yeast in
a lump of dough, that enlivens the whole. Nature seems to wish that
the foot would leave the path, that she may cover it with grass. He
will find this vegetative power so strong, that it even attends the
small detached parts of the soil where-ever they go, provided they
are within reach of air and moisture: He will not only observe it
in the small pots, appropriated for garden use, but on the tops of
houses, remote from any road, where the wind has carried any small
dust. He will also observe it in cracks of the rocks; but in an
amazing degree in the thick walls of ruined castles, where, by a
long course of time, the decayed materials are converted into a
kind of soil, and so well covered with grass, that if one of our
old castle builders could return to his possessions, he might mow
his house as well as his field, and procure a tolerable crop from
both.</p>
<p>In those pits, upon an eminence, the soil will be found deep
enough for any mode of husbandry. In those of the vallies, which
take in the small drain of the adjacent parts, it is much deeper.
That upon the road, which rather gives than receives any addition
from drain, the average depth is about four inches.</p>
<p>The soil is not only increased by the causes above, but also by
the constant decays of the growth upon it. The present vegetable
generation falling to decay, adds to the soil, and also, assists
the next generation, which in a short time follows the same
course.</p>
<p>The author of the History of Sutton says, "The poor inhabitants
are supplied with fuel from a magazine of peat, near the Roman
road, composed of thousands of fir trees cut down by the Romans, to
enable them to pass over a morass. The bodies of the trees are
sometimes dug up found, with the marks of the axe upon them."</p>
<p>Are we then to suppose, by this curious historical anecdote,
that the inhabitants of Sutton have run away with this celebrated
piece of antiquity? That the cart, instead of rolling <i>over</i>
the military way, has rolled <i>under</i> it, and that they have
boiled the pot with the Roman road?</p>
<p>Upon inquiry, they seemed more inclined to credit the fact, than
able to prove it; but I can find no such morass, neither is the
road any where broken up. Perhaps it would be as difficult to find
the trees, as the axe that cut them: Besides, the fir is not a
native of Britain, but of Russia; and I believe our forefathers,
the Britons, were not complete masters of the art of transplanting.
The park of Sutton was probably a bed of oaks, the natural weed of
the country, long before Moses figured in history.</p>
<p>Whilst the political traveller is contemplating this
extraordinary production of antiquity, of art, and of labour, his
thoughts will naturally recur to the authors of it.</p>
<p>He will find them proficients in science, in ambition, in taste:
They added dominion to conquest, 'till their original territory
became too narrow a basis to support the vast fabric acquired by
the success of their arms: The monstrous bulk fell to destruction
by its own weight.--Man was not made for universality; if he grasps
at little, he may retain it; if at much, he may lose all.</p>
<p>The confusion, natural on such occasions, produced anarchy: At
that moment, the military stept into the government, and the people
became slaves.</p>
<p>Upon the ruins of this brave race, the Bishop of Rome founded an
ecclesiastical jurisdiction. His power increasing with his
votaries, he found means to link all christendom to the triple
crown, and acquired an unaccountable ascendency over the human
mind: The princes of Europe were harnessed, like so many coach
horses. The pontiff directed the bridle. He sometimes used the
whip, and sometimes the curse. The thunder of his throne rattled
through the world with astonishing effect, 'till that most useful
discovery, the art of printing, in the fifteenth century, dissolved
the charm, and set the oppressed cattle at liberty; who began to
kick their driver. Henry the Eighth of England, was the first
unruly animal in the papal team, and the sagacious Cranmer assisted
in breaking the shackles.</p>
<p>We have, in our day, seen an order of priesthood in the church
of Rome, annihilated by the consent of the European princes, which
the Pope beheld in silence.</p>
<p>"There is an ultimate point of exaltation, and reduction, beyond
which human affairs cannot proceed." Rome, seems to have
experienced both, for she is at this day one of the most
contemptible states in the scale of empire.</p>
<p>This will of course lead the traveller's thoughts towards
Britain, where he will find her sons by nature inclined to a love
of arms, of liberty, and of commerce. These are the strong outlines
of national character, the interior parts of which are finished
with the softer touches of humanity, of science, and of luxury. He
will also find, that there is a natural boundary to every country,
beyond which it is dangerous to add dominion. That the boundary of
Britain is the sea: That her external strength is her navy, which
protects her frontiers, and her commerce: That her internal is
unanimity: That when her strength is united within herself, she is
invincible, and the balance of Europe will be fixed in her hand,
which she ought never to let go.</p>
<p>But if she accumulates territory, though she may profit at
first, she weakens her power by dividing it; for the more she fends
abroad, the less will remain at home; and, instead of giving law to
the tyrant, she may be obliged to receive law from him.</p>
<p>That, by a multiplicity of additions, her little isles will be
lost in the great map of dominion.</p>
<p>That, if she attempts to draw that vast and growing empire,
America, she may herself be drawn to destruction; for, by every law
of attraction, the greater draws the less--The mouse was never
meant to direct the ox. That the military and the ecclesiastical
powers are necessary in their places, that is, subordinate to the
civil.</p>
<p>But my companion will remember that Birmingham is our historical
mark, therefore we must retreat to that happy abode of the smiling
arts. If he has no taste for antiquity, I have detained him too
long upon this hungry, though delightful spot. If he has, he will
leave the enchanted ground with reluctance; will often turn his
head to repeat the view, 'till the prospect is totally lost.</p>

<h2><a name="LORDS_OF_THE_MANOR."></a>LORDS OF THE MANOR.</h2>
<br>
<p>By the united voice of our historians, it appears, that as the
Saxons conquered province after province, which was effected in
about one hundred and thirty years, the unfortunate Britons
retreated into Wales: But we are not to suppose that all the
inhabitants ran away, and left a desolate region to the victor;
this would have been of little more value to the conqueror, than
the possession of Sutton Coldfield or Bromsgrove Lickey. The
mechanic and the peasant were left, which are by far the greatest
number; they are also the riches of a country; stamp a value upon
property, and it becomes current. As they have nothing to lose, so
they have nothing to fear; for let who will be master, they must be
drudges: Their safety consists in their servitude; the victor is
ever conscious of their utility, therefore their protection is
certain.</p>
<p>But the danger lies with the man of substance, and the greater
that substance, the greater his anxiety to preserve it, and the
more danger to himself if conquered: These were the people who
retreated into Wales. Neither must we consider the wealth of that
day to consist of bags of cash, bills of exchange, India bonds,
bank stock, etc. no such thing existed. Property lay in the land,
and the herds that fed upon it. And here I must congratulate our
Welch neighbours, who are most certainly descended from gentlemen;
and I make no doubt but the Cambrian reader will readily unite in
the same sentiment.</p>
<p>The Saxons, as conquerors, were too proud to follow the modes of
the conquered, therefore they introduced government, laws,
language, customs and habits of their own. Hence we date the
division of the kingdom into manors.</p>
<p>Human nature is nearly the same in all ages. Where value is
marked upon property or power, it will find its votaries: Whoever
was the most deserving, or rather could make the most interest,
procured land sufficient for an Elderman, now Earl; the next class,
a Manor; and the inferior, who had borne the heat and burthen of
the day--nothing.</p>
<p>I must now introduce an expression which I promised not to
forget.--In the course of a trial between William de Birmingham,
and the inhabitants of Bromsgrove and King's-norton, in 1309,
concerning the right of tollage; it appeared, That the ANCESTORS of
the said William had a market here before the Norman conquest. This
proves, that the family of Birmingham were of Saxon race, and Lords
of the Manor prior to that period.</p>
<p>Mercia was not only the largest, but also the last of the seven
conquered kingdoms--It was bounded on the North by the Humber, on
the West by the Severn, on the South by the Thames, and on the East
by the German ocean. Birmingham lies nearly in the centre. Cridda,
a Saxon, came over with a body of troops, and reduced it in 582;
therefore, as no after revolution happened that could cause
Birmingham to change its owner, and as land was not in a very
saleable state at that time, there is the greatest reason to
suppose the founder of the house of Birmingham Came over with
Cridda, as an officer in his army, and procured this little
flourishing dominion as a reward for his service.</p>
<p>The succeeding generations of this illustrious family are too
remote for historical penetration, 'till the reign of Edward the
Confessor, the last of the Saxon Kings, when we find, in 1050,</p>

<h3>1066,</h3>
<br>
<p>seems to have succeeded him, and to have lived in that
unfortunate period for property, the conquest.</p>
<p>The time was now arrived when this ancient family, with the rest
of the English gentry, who had lived under the benign climate of
Saxon government, and in the affluence of fortune, must quit the
happy regions of hospitality, and enter the gloomy precincts of
penury--From givers, they were to become beggars.</p>
<p>The whole conduct of William seems to have carried the strongest
marks of conquest. Many of the English lost their lives, some their
liberty, and nearly all their estates. The whole land in the
kingdom was insufficient to satisfy the hungry Normans.</p>
<p>Perhaps William took the wisest method to secure the conquered
country that could be devised by human wisdom; he parcelled out the
kingdom among his greater Barons; the whole county of Chester is
said to have fallen to the share of Hugh Lupus: and these were
subdivided into 62,000 Knight's-sees, which were held under the
great Barons by military service. Thus the Sovereign by only
signifying his pleasure to the Barons, could instantly raise an
army for any purpose. We cannot produce a stronger indication of
arbitrary government: But, it is happy for the world, that
perfection is not found even in human wisdom; for this well laid
scheme destroyed itself. Instead of making the crown absolute, as
was intended, it threw the balance into the hands of the Barons,
who became so many petty Sovereigns, and a scourge to the King in
after ages, 'till Henry the Seventh sapped their power, and raised
the third estate, the Commons, which quickly eclipsed the other
two.</p>
<p>The English gentry suffered great distress: Their complaints
rung loud in the royal ear, some of them therefore, who had been
peaceable and never opposed the Normans, were suffered to enjoy
their estates in dependance upon the great Barons.</p>
<p>This was the case with Richard, Lord of Birmingham, who held
this manor by knight's-service of William Fitz-Ausculf, Lord of
Dudley castle, and perhaps all the land between the two places.</p>
<p>Thus Birmingham, now rising towards the meridian of opulence,
was a dependant upon Dudley castle, now in ruins; and thus an
honourable family, who had enjoyed a valuable freehold, perhaps
near 500 years, were obliged to pay rent, homage, suit and service,
attend the Lord's court at Dudley every three weeks, be called into
the field at pleasure, and after all, possess a precarious tenure
in villainage.</p>
<p>The blood of the ancient English was not only tainted with the
breath of that destructive age, but their lands also. The powerful
blast destroyed their ancient freehold tenures, reducing them into
wretched copyholds: and to the disgrace of succeeding ages, many of
them retain this mark of Norman slavery to the present day. How
defective are those laws, which give one man power over another in
neutral cases? That tend to promote quarrels, prevent cultivation,
and which cannot draw the line between property and property?</p>
<p>Though a spirit of bravery is certainly a part of the British
character, yet there are two or three periods in English history,
when this noble flame was totally extinguished. Every degree of
resolution seems to have been cut off at the battle of Hastings.
The English acted contrary to their usual manner:--Danger had often
made them desperate, but now it made them humble. This conquest is
one of the most extraordinary held forth in history; the flower of
nobility was wholly nipped off; the spirit of the English
depressed, and having no head to direct, or hand to cultivate the
courage of the people and lead it into action, it dwindled at the
root, was trampled under the foot of tyranny, and, according to
<i>Smollet</i>, several generations elapsed before any one of the
old English stock blossomed into peerage.</p>
<p>It is curious to contemplate the revolution of things--Though
the conquering Romans flood first in the annals of same at the
beginning of the Christian era, yet they were a whole century in
carrying their illustrious arms over the island, occupied only by a
despicable race of Britons. Though the Saxons were invited, by one
false step in politics, to assist the Britons in expelling an
enemy, which gave them an opportunity of becoming enemies
themselves; yet it was 130 years before they could complete their
conquest. And though the industrious Dane poured incessant numbers
of people into Britain, yet it cost them 200 years, and 150,000 men
before they reduced it. But William, at one blow, finished the
dreadful work, shackled her sons to his throne, and governed them
with a sceptre of iron. Normandy, a petty dukedom, very little
larger than Yorkshire, conquered a mighty nation in one day.
England seems to have been taken by storm, and her liberties put to
the sword: Nor did the miseries of this ill-fated kingdom end here,
for the continental dominions, which William annexed to the crown,
proved a whirlpool for 400 years, which drew the blood and treasure
of the nation into its vortex, 'till those dominions were
fortunately lost in the reign of Mary the First.</p>
<p>Thus the Romans spent one century in acquiring a kingdom, which
they governed for four. The Saxons spent 130 years, and ruled for
459. The Danes spent 200 and reigned for 25--But the Norman spent
one day only, for a reign of 700 years: They continue to reign
still.</p>
<p>It is easy to point out some families of Norman race, who yet
enjoy the estates won by their ancestors at the battle of
Hastings.</p>

male line of the Fitz-Ausculfs soon became extinct, and Gervase
Paganell marrying the heiress, became Baron of Dudley-castle.</p>

<h3>1154.</h3>
<br>
<p>It is common in every class of life, for the inferior to imitate
the superior: If the real lady claims a head-dress sixteen inches
high, that of the imaginary lady will immediately begin to thrive.
The family, or surname, entered with William the First, and was
soon the reigning taste of the day: A person was thought of no
consequence without a surname, and even the depressed English,
crept into the fashion, in imitation of their masters. I have
already mentioned the Earl of Warwick, father of a numerous race
now in Birmingham; whose name before the conquest was simply
Turchill, but after, Turchill de Arden, (Matter of the Woods) from
his own estate.</p>
<p>Thus the family of whom I speak, chose to dignify themselves
with the name of <i>de Birmingham</i>.</p>
<p>Peter wisely consulted his own interest, kept fair with Paganall
his Lord, and obtained from him, in 1166, nine Knight's-fees, which
he held by military service.</p>
<p>A Knight's-fee, though uncommon now, was a word well understood
600 years ago. It did not mean, as some have imagined, fifteen
pounds per annum, nor any determinate sum; but as much land as
would support a gentleman. This Peter was fewer to Paganall,
(waited at his table) though a man of great property.</p>
<p>The splendor in which the great Barons of that age lived, was
little inferior to royalty.</p>
<p>The party distinctions also of Saxon and Norman, in the twelfth
century, began to die away, as the people became united by interest
or marriage, like that of Whig and Tory, in the eighteenth. And
perhaps there is not at present a native that does not carry in his
veins the blood of the four nations that were grafted upon the
Britons.</p>
<p>Peter himself lived in affluence at his castle, then near
Birmingham, now the Moat, of which in the next section. He also
obtained from Henry the Second, as well as from Paganall the Lord
paramount, several valuable privileges for his favourite
inheritance of Birmingham. He bore for his arms, <i>azure, a bend
lozenge</i>, of five points, <i>or</i>; the coat of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>At the reduction of Ireland, in the reign of Henry the Second, a
branch of this family, and perhaps uncle to William, was very
instrumental under Richard Strongbow, Earl of Pembroke, in
accomplishing that great end; for which he was rewarded with a
large estate, and the title of Earl of Lowth, both which continue

<br>
<p>By this time, the male line of the Paganalls was worn out, and
Roger de Someri marrying the heiress, became Baron of Dudley, with
all its dependencies; but Someri and Birmingham did not keep peace,
as their fathers had done. William, being very rich, forgot to ride
to Dudley every three weeks, to perform suit and service at
Someri's court.</p>
<p>Whereupon a contest commenced to enforce the performance. But,
in 1262, it was agreed between the contending parties--That William
should attend the Lord's court only twice a year, Easter and
Michaelmas, and at such other times, as the Lord chose to command
by special summons. This William, having married the daughter of
Thomas de Astley, a man of great eminence, and both joining with
the Barons under Simon Mountfort, Earl of Leicester, against Henry
the Third, William fell, in 1265, at the battle of Evesham; and as
the loser is ever the rebel, the Barons were prescribed, and their
estates confiscated.</p>
<p>The manor of Birmingham, therefore, valued at forty pounds per
annum, was seized by the King, and given to his favorite, Roger de
Clifford.</p>

<br>
<p>By a law called the statute of Kenilworth, every man who had
forfeited his estate to the crown, by having taken up arms, had
liberty to redeem his lands, by a certain fine: William therefore
paid that fine, and recovered the inheritance of his family. He
also, in 1283 strengthened his title by a charter from Edward the
First, and likewise to the other manors he possessed, such as
Stockton, in the County of Worcester; Shetford, in Oxfordshire;
Maidencoat, in Berkshire; Hoggeston, in the county of Bucks; and
Christleton, in Cheshire.</p>
<p>In 1285, Edward brought his writ of quo warranto, whereby every
holder of land was obliged to show by what title he held it. The
consequence would have been dreadful to a Prince of less prudence
than Edward. Some showed great unwillingness; for a dormant title
will not always bear examination--But William producing divers
charters, clearly proved his right to every manorial privilege,
such as market, toll, tem, sack, sok, insangenthief, weyfs,
gallows, court-leet, and pillory, with a right to fix the standard
for bread and beer; all which were allowed.</p>
<p>William, Lord of Birmingham, being a military tenant, was
obliged to attend the King into Gascoigne, 1297, where he lost his
liberty at the siege of Bellgard, and was carried prisoner in
triumph to Paris.</p>

<h3>1316.</h3>
<br>
<p>Was knighted in 1325; well affected to Edward the Second, for
whose service he raised four hundred foot. Time seems to have put a
period to the family of Someri, Lords of Dudley, as well as to
those of their predecessors, the Paganalls, and the
Fitz-Ausculfs.</p>
<p>In 1327, the first of Edward the Third, Sir William was summoned
to Parliament, by the title of William Lord Birmingham, but not
after.</p>
<p>It was not the fashion of that day to fill the House of Peers by
patent. The greater Barons held a local title from their Baronies;
the possessor of one of these, claimed a seat among the Lords.</p>
<p>I think, they are now all extinct, except Arundel, the property
of the Norfolk family, and whoever is proprietor of Arundel castle,
is Earl thereof by ancient prescription.</p>
<p>The lesser Barons were called up to the House by writ, which did
not confer an hereditary title. Of this class was the Lord of
Birmingham.</p>
<p>Hugh Spencer, the favourite of the weak Edward the Second, had
procured the custody of Dudley-castle, with all its appendages, for
his friend William, Lord Birmingham.</p>
<p>Thus the family who had travelled from Birmingham to Dudley
every three weeks, to perform humble suit at the Lord's court, held
that very court by royal appointment, to receive the fealty of
others.</p>
<p>By the patent which constituted William keeper of Dudley-castle,
he was obliged to account for the annual profits arising from that
vast estate into the King's exchequer. When, therefore, in 1334, he
delivered in his accounts, the Barons refused to admit them,
because the money was defective. But he had interest enough with
the crown to cause a mandamus to be issued, commanding the Barons
to admit them.</p>

and was successively returned to serve in Parliament for the

daughter of William de la Planch, by whom he had no issue. She
afterwards married the Lord Clinton, retained the manor of
Birmingham as her dower, and lived to the year 1424.</p>
<p>It does not appear in this illustrious family, that the regular
line of descent, from father to son, was ever broken, from the time
of the Saxons, 'till 1390. This Sir John left a brother, Sir Thomas
de Birmingham, heir at law, who enjoyed the bulk of his brother's
fortune; but was not to possess the manor of Birmingham 'till the
widow's death, which not happening 'till after his own, he never
enjoyed it.</p>
<p>The Lord Clinton and his Lady seem to have occupied the
Manor-house; and Sir Thomas, unwilling to quit the place of his
affections and of his nativity, erected a castle for himself at
Worstone, near the Sand-pits, joining the Ikenield-street; street;
where, though the building is totally gone, the vestiges of its
liquid security are yet complete. This Sir Thomas enjoyed several
public offices, and figured in the style of his ancestors. He left
a daughter, who married Thomas de la Roche, and from this marriage
sprang two daughters; the eldest of which married Edmund, Lord
Ferrers of Chartley, who, at the decease of Sir John's widow,
inherited the manor, and occupied the Manor house. There yet stands
a building on the North-east side of the Moat, erected by this Lord
Ferrers, with his arms in the timbers of the ceiling, and the
crest, a horse-shoe.</p>
<p>I take this house to be the oldest in Birmingham, though it hath
not that appearance; having stood about 350 years.</p>
<p>By an entail of the manor upon the male line, the Lady Ferrers
seems to have quitted her title in favor of a second cousin, a
descendant of William de Birmingham, brother to Sir Fouk.</p>

sometimes the Lord's necessities taught him to think that money was
more <i>Solid</i> than suit and service; an agreement was entered
into, for money instead of homage, between the Lord and the

of bastard freehold:--The tenant held a certainty, while he
conformed to the agreement; or, in other words, the custom of the

should ever be under the protection of law; and, what was Edward's
case to-day, might be that of any other man to-morrow. But the
oppressor kept fair with the crown, and the crown held a rod of
iron over the people.--Suffer me to tell the mournful tale from
Dugdale's Antiquities of Warwickshire.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2>1537,</h2>
<br>
<p>John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, a man of great wealth,
unbounded ambition, and one of the basest characters of the age,
was possessor of Dudley-castle, and the fine estate belonging to
it:--He wished to add Birmingham to his vast domain. Edward
Birmingham therefore was privately founded, respecting the disposal
of his manor; but as money was not wanted, and as the place had
been the honor and the residence of his family for many centuries,
it was out of the reach of purchase.</p>
<p>Northumberland was so charmed with its beauty, he was determined
to possess it; and perhaps the manner in which he accomplished his
design, cannot be paralleled in the annals of infamy.</p>
<p>He procured two or three rascals of his own temper, and rather
of mean appearance, to avoid suspicion, to take up their quarters
for a night or two in Birmingham, and gain secret intelligence when
Edward Birmingham should ride out, and what road: This done, one of
the rascals was to keep before the others, but all took care that
Edward should easily overtake them. Upon his arrival at the first
class, the villains joined him, entered into chat, and all moved
soberly together 'till they reached the first man; when, on a
sudden, the strangers with Edward drew their pistols and robbed
their brother villain, who no doubt lost a considerable sum after a
decent resistance. Edward was easily known, apprehended, and
committed as one of the robbers; the others were not to be
found.</p>
<p>Edward immediately saw himself on the verge of destruction. He
could only <i>alledge</i>, but not <i>prove</i> his innocence: All
the proof the case could admit of, was against him.</p>
<p>Northumberland (then only Lord L'Isle) hitherto had succeeded to
his wish; nor was Edward long in suspence--Private hints were given
him, that the only way to save his life, was to make Northumberland
his friend; and this probably might be done, by resigning to him
his manor of Birmingham; with which the unfortunate Edward
reluctantly complied.</p>
<p>Northumberland thinking a common conveyance insufficient, caused
Edward to yield his estate into the hands of the King, and had
interest enough in that age of injustice to procure a ratification
from a weak Parliament, by which means he endeavoured to throw the
odium off his own character, and fix it upon theirs, and also,
procure to himself a safer title.</p>
<p>An extract from that base act is as follows:--</p>
<p>"Whereas Edward Byrmingham, late of Byrmingham in the countie of
Warwick, Esquire, otherwise callid Edward Byrmingham, Esquire, ys
and standyth lawfully indettid to our soverene Lord the Kinge, in
diverse grete summes of money; and also standyth at the mercy of
his Highness, for that the same Edward ys at this present convected
of felony: Our seide soverene Lord the Kinge ys contentid and
pleasid, that for and in recompence and satisfaction to his Grace
of the seyde summes of money, to accept and take of the seyde
Edward the mannour and lordship of Byrmingham, otherwise callid
Byrmincham, with the appurtinances, lying and being in the countie
of Warwick, and all and singuler other lands and tenements,
reversions, rents, services, and hereditaments of the same Edward
Byrmingham, set, lying and beying in the countie of Warwick
aforesaid. Be yt therefore ordeyned and enacted, by the authoritie
of this present Parliament, that our seyde soverene Lord the Kinge
shall have, hold, and enjoy, to him and his heires and assignes for
ever, the seyde mannour and lordship of Byrmingham, &amp;c."</p>
<p>In the act there is a reservation of 40<i>l</i>. per annum,
during the lives only of the said Edward and his wife.</p>
<p>It appears also, by an expression in the act, that Edward was
brought to trial, and found guilty. Thus innocence is depressed for
want of support; property is wrested for want of the protection of
the law; and a vile minister, in a corrupt age, can carry an
infamous point through a court of justice, the two Houses of
Parliament, and complete his horrid design by the sanction of a
tyrant.</p>
<p>The place where tradition tells us this diabolical transaction
happened, is the middle of Sandy-lane, in the Sutton road; the
upper part of which begins at the North east corner of Aston park
wall; at the bottom, you bear to the left, for Sawford-bridge, or
to the right, for Nachell's-green; about two miles from the Moat,
the place of Edward's abode.</p>
<p>Except that branch which proceeded from this original stem,
about 600 years ago, of which the Earl of Lowth is head, I know of
no male descendant from this honourable stock; who, if we allow the
founder to have come over with Cridda, the Saxon, in 582, must have
commanded this little Sovereignty 955 years.</p>
<p>I met with a person sometime ago of the name of Birmingham, and
was pleased with the hope of finding a member of that ancient and
honorable house; but he proved so amasingly ignorant, he could not
tell whether he was from the clouds, the sea, or the dunghill:
instead of traceing the existence of his ancestors, even so high as
his father, he was scarcely conscious of his own.</p>
<p>As this house did not much abound with daughters, I cannot at
present recollect any families among us, except that of
Bracebridge, who are descended from this illustrious origin, by a
female line; and Sir John Talbot Dillon, who is descended from the
ancient Earls of Lowth, as he is from the De Veres, the more
ancient Earls of Oxford.</p>
<p>Here, then, I unwillingly extinguish that long range of lights,
which for many ages illuminated the house of Birmingham.</p>
<p>But I cannot extinguish the rascallity of the line of
Northumberland. This unworthy race, proved a scourge to the world,
at least during three generations. Each, in his turn, presided in
the British cabinet; and each seems to have possessed the villainy
of his predecessor, united with his own. The first, only
<i>served</i> a throne; but the second and the third intended to
<i>fill</i> one. A small degree of ambition warms the mind in
pursuit of fame, through the paths of honor; while too large a
portion tends to unfavorable directions, kindles to a flame,
consumes the finer sensations of rectitude, and leaves a stench
behind.</p>
<p>Edmund, the father of this John, was the voracious leech, with
Empson, who sucked the vitals of the people, to feed the avarice of
Henry the Seventh.</p>
<p>It is singular that Henry, the most sagacious prince since the
conquest, loaded him with honours for filling the royal coffers
with wealth, which the penurious monarch durst never enjoy: but his
successor, Henry the Eighth, enjoyed the pleasure of consuming that
wealth, and <i>executed</i> the father for collecting it! How much
are our best laid schemes defective? How little does expectation
and event coincide? It is no disgrace to a man that he died on the
scaffold; the question is--What brought him there? Some of the most
inoffensive, and others the most exalted characters of the age in
which they lived, have been cut off by the axe, as Edward
Plantagenet, Earl of Warwick, for being the last male heir of the
Anjouvin Kings; John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, Sir Thomas Moore,
Sir Walter Raleigh, Algernon Sidney, William Lord Russell, &amp;c.
whose blood ornamented the scaffold on which they fell.</p>
<p>The son of this man, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, favorite
of Queen Elizabeth, is held up by our historians as a master-piece
of dissimulation, pride, and cruelty. He married three wives, all
which he is charged with sending to the grave by untimely deaths;
one of them, to open a passage to the Queen's bed, to which he
aspired. It is surprising, that he should deceive the penetrating
eye of Elizabeth: but I am much inclined to think she <i>knew
him</i> better than the world; and they knew him rather to well. He
ruined many of the English gentry, particularly the ancient family
of Arden, of Park-hall, in this neighbourhood: he afterwards ruined
his own family by disinheriting a son, more worthy than
himself.--If he did not fall by the executioner, it is no proof
that he did not deserve it.--We now behold</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN,_DUKE_OF_NORTHUMBERLAND,"></a>JOHN, DUKE OF

<br>
<p>Lord of the manor of Birmingham; a man, who of all others the
least deserved that honor; or rather, deserved the axe for being
so.</p>
<p>Some have asserted, "That property acquired by dishonesty cannot
prosper." But I shall leave the philosopher and the enthusiast to
settle that important point, while I go on to observe, That that
the lordship of Birmingham did not prosper with the Duke. Though he
had, in some degree, the powers of government in his hands, he had
also the clamours of the people in his ears. What were his inward
feelings, is uncertain at this distance--Fear seems to have
prevented him from acknowledging Birmingham for his property.
Though he exercised every act of ownership, yet he suffered the
fee-simple to rest in the crown, 'till nine years had elapsed, and
those clamours subsided, before he ventured to accept the grant, in
1546.</p>
<p>As the execution of this grant was one of the last acts of
Henry's life, we should be apt to suspect the Duke carried it in
his pocket ready for signing, but deferred the matter as long as he
could with safety, that distance of time might annihilate
reflection; and that the King's death, which happened a few weeks
after, might draw the attention of the world too much, by the
importance of the event, to regard the Duke's conduct.</p>
<p>The next six years, which carries us through the reign of Edward
the Sixth, is replete with the intrigues of this illustrious knave.
He sought connections with the principal families: He sought
honours for his own: He procured a match between his son, the Lord
Guildford Dudley, and the Lady Jane Gray, daughter of the Duke of
Suffolk, and a descendant from Henry the Seventh, with intent of
fixing the crown in his family, but failing in the attempt, he
brought ruin upon the Suffolk family, and himself to the block, in
the first of Queen Mary, 1553.</p>
<p>Though a man be guilty of many atrocious acts that deserve
death, yet in the hour of distress humanity demands the tear of
compassion; but the case was otherwise at the execution of John,
Duke of Northumberland, for a woman near the scaffold held forth a
bloody handkerchief and exclaimed, "Behold the blood of the Duke of
Somerset, shed by your means, and which cries for vengeance against
you."</p>
<p>Thus Northumberland kept a short and rough possession of glory;
thus he fell unlamented; and thus the manor of Birmingham reverted
to the crown a second time, the Duke himself having first taught it
the way.</p>

<h2><a name="MANOR_HOUSE."></a>MANOR HOUSE.</h2>
<h3>(The Moat.)</h3>
<br>
<p>The natural temper of the human mind, like that of the brute, is
given to plunder: This temper is very apt to break forth into
action. In all societies of men, therefore, restraints have been
discovered, under the name of laws, attended with punishment, to
deter people from infringing each others property. Every thing that
a man can possess, falls under the denomination of property;
whether it be life, liberty, wealth or character.</p>
<p>The less perfect these laws are, the less a people are removed
from the rude state of nature, and the more necessity there is for
a man to be constantly in a state of defence, that he may be able
to repel any force that shall rise up against him.</p>
<p>It is easy to discover, by the laws of a country, how far the
people are advanced in civilization. If the laws are defective, or
the magistrate too weak to execute them, it is dangerous for a man
to possess property.</p>
<p>But when a nation is pretty far advanced in social existence;
when the laws agree with reason, and are executed with firmness, a
man need not trouble himself concerning the protection of his
property--his country will protect it for him.</p>
<p>The laws of England have, for many ages, been gradually
refining; and are capable of that protection which violence never
was.</p>
<p>But if we penetrate back into the recesses of time, we shall
find the laws inadequate, the manners savage, force occupy the
place of justice, and property unprotected. In those barbarous
ages, therefore, men sought security by intrenching themselves from
a world they could not trust. This was done by opening a large
ditch round their habitation, which they filled with water, and
which was only approachable by a draw-bridge. This, in some degree,
supplied the defect of the law, and the want of power in the
magistrate. It also, during the iron reign of priesthood, furnished
that table in lent, which it guarded all the year.</p>
<p>The Britons had a very slender knowledge of fortification. The
camps they left us, are chiefly upon eminences, girt by a shallow
ditch, bordered with stone, earth, or timber, but never with water.
The moat, therefore, was introduced by the Romans; their camps are
often in marshes; some wholly, and some in part surrounded by
water.</p>
<p>These liquid barriers were begun in England early in the
christian &aelig;ra, they were in the zenith of their glory at the
barons wars, in the reign of king John, and continued to be the
mode of fortification till the introduction of guns, in the reign
of Edward the fourth, which shook their foundation; and the civil
wars of Charles the first totally annihilated their use, after an
existence of twelve hundred years.</p>
<p>Perhaps few parishes, that have been the ancient habitation of a
gentleman, are void of some traces of these fluid bulwarks. That of
Birmingham has three; one of these, of a square form, at Warstone,
erected by a younger brother of the house of Birmingham, hath
already been mentioned; it is fed by a small rivulet from Rotton
Park, which crosses the Dudley Road, near the Sand pits.</p>
<p>Another is the Parsonage house, belonging to St. Martin's,
formerly situated in the road to Bromsgrove, now Smallbrook street,
of a circular figure, and supplied by a neighbouring spring. If we
allow this watery circle to be a proof of the great antiquity of
the house, it is a much greater with regard to the antiquity of the
church.</p>
<p>The third is what we simply denominate the Moat, and was the
residence of the ancient lords of Birmingham, situated about sixty
yards south of the church, and twenty west of Digbeth; this is also
circular, and supplied by a small stream that crosses the road to
Bromsgrove, near the first mile stone; it originally ran into the
river Rea, near Vaughton's hole, dividing the parishes of
Birmingham and Edgbaston all the way, but at the formation of the
Moat, was diverted from its course, into which it never
returned.</p>
<p>No certain evidence remains to inform us when this liquid work
was accomplished: perhaps in the Saxon heptarchy, when there were
few or no buildings south of the church. Digbeth seems to have been
one of the first streets added to this important school of arts;
the upper part of that street must of course have been formed
first: but, that the Moat was completed prior to the erection of
any buildings between that and Digbeth, is evident, because those
buildings stand upon the very soil thrown out in forming the
Moat.</p>
<p>The first certain account that we meet with of this guardian
circle, is in the reign of Henry the Second, 1154, when Peter de
Birmingham, then lord of the see, had a cattle here, and lived in
splendor. All the succeeding Lords resided upon the same island,
till their cruel expulsion by John Duke of Northumberland in
1537.</p>
<p>The old castle followed its lords, and is buried in the ruins of
time. Upon the spot, about forty years ago, rose a house in the
modern style, occupied by a manufacturer (John Francis;) in one of
the out-buildings is shewn, the apartment where the ancient lords
kept their court leet; another out-building which stands to the
east, I have already observed, was the work of Edmund Lord
Ferrers.</p>
<p>The ditch being filled with water, has nearly the same
appearance now as perhaps a thousand years ago, but not altogether
the same use. It then served to protect its master, but now, to
turn a thread-mill.</p>

<br>
<p>Near the place where the small rivulet discharges itself into
the Moat, another of the same size is carried over it, called
Pudding Brook, and proceeds from the town as this advances towards
it, producing a curiosity seldom met with; one river running South,
and the other North, for half a mile, yet only a path-road of three
feet asunder; which surprised Brindley the famous engineer.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PRIORY."></a>THE PRIORY.</h2>
<br>
<p>The site of this ancient edifice is now the Square; some small
remains of the old foundations are yet visible in the cellars,
chiefly on the South-east. The out-buildings and pleasure-grounds
perhaps occupied the whole North east side of Bull-street, then
uninhabited, and only the highway to Wolverhampton; bounded on the
North-west by Steelhouse-lane; on the North-east by Newton and
John's-street; and on the South-east by Dale-end, which also was no
other than the highway to Lichfield--The whole, about fourteen
acres.</p>
<p>The building upon this delightful eminence, which at that time
commanded the small but beautiful prospect of Bristland-fields,
Rowley-hills, Oldbury, Smethewick, Handsworth, Sutton-Coldfield,
Erdington, Saltley, the Garrison, and Camp-hill, and which then
stood at a distance from the town, though now near its centre; was
founded by the house of Birmingham, in the early reigns of the
Norman Kings, and called the Hospital of Saint Thomas,--The priest
being bound to pray for the souls of the founders every day, to the
end of the world.</p>
<p>In 1285, Thomas de Madenhache, Lord of the manor of Aston, gave
ten acres of land in his manor. William de Birmingham ten, which I
take to be the land where the Priory stood; and Ranulph de Rakeby
three acres, in Saltley: About the same time, sundry others gave
houses and land in smaller quantities: William de Birmingham gave
afterwards twenty-two acres more. The same active spirit seems to
have operated in our ancestors, 500 years ago, that does in their
descendants at this day: If a new scheme strikes the fancy, it is
pursued with vigor.</p>
<p>The religious fervor of that day ran high: It was unfashionable
to leave the world, and not remember the Priory. Donations crowded
in so fast, that the prohibiting act was forgot; so that in 1311,
the brotherhood were prosecuted by the crown, for appropriating
lands contrary to the act of mortmain; But these interested
priests, like their sagacious brethren, knew as well how to
preserve as to gain property; for upon their humble petition to the
throne, Edward the Second put a stop to the judicial proceedings,
and granted a special pardon.</p>
<p>In 1351, Fouk de Birmingham, and Richard Spencer, jointly gave
to the priory one hundred acres of land, part lying in Aston, and
part in Birmingham, to maintain another priest, who should
celebrate divine service daily at the altar of the Virgin Mary, in
the church of the hospital, for the souls of William la Mercer, and
his wife. The church is supposed to have stood upon the spot now
No. 27, in Bull-street.</p>
<p>In the premises belonging to the Red Bull, No. 83, nearly
opposite, have been discovered human bones, which has caused some
to suppose it the place of interment for the religious, belonging
to the priory, which I rather doubt.</p>
<p>At the dissolution of the abbies, in 1536, the King's visitors
valued the annual income at the trifling sum of 8<i>l</i>. 8s.
9d.</p>
<p>The patronage continued chiefly in the head of the Birmingham
family. Dugdale gives us a list of some of the Priors, who held
dominion in this little common wealth, from 1326, 'till the total
annihilation, being 210 years.</p>
<blockquote>Robert Marmion,<br>
Robert Cappe,<br>
Thomas Edmunds,<br>
John Frothward,<br>
Robert Browne,<br>
John Port,<br>
William Priestwood,<br>
Henry Drayton,<br>
John Cheyne,<br>
Henry Bradley,<br>
Thomas Salpin,<br>
Sir Edward Toste,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND<br>
Henry Hody.</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, a man of much honour, more
capacity, and yet more spirit, was the instrument with which Henry
the Eighth destroyed the abbies; but Henry, like a true politician
of the house of Tudor, wisely threw the blame upon the instrument,
held it forth to the public in an odious light, and then sacrificed
it to appease an angry people.</p>
<p>This destructive measure against the religious houses,
originated from royal letchery, and was replete with
consequence.</p>
<p>It opened the fountains of learning, at that day confined to the
monastry, and the streams diffused themselves through various ranks
of men. The revival of letters and of science made a rapid
progress: It soon appeared, that the stagnate knowledge of the
priest, was abundantly mixed with error; but now, running through
the laity, who had no private interest to serve, it became more
pure.</p>
<p>It removed great numbers of men, who lay as a dead weight upon
the community, and they became useful members of society: When
younger sons could no longer find an asylum within the gloomy walls
of a convent, they sought a livelihood in trade. Commerce,
therefore, was taught to crowd her sails, cross the western ocean,
fill the country with riches, and change an idle spirit into that
of industry.</p>
<p>By the destruction of religious houses, architecture sustained a
temporary wound: They were by far the most magnificent and
expensive buildings in the kingdoms, far surpassing those of the
nobility; some of these structures are yet habitable, though the
major part are gone to decay. But modern architecture hath since
out-done the former splendor of the abbey, in use and elegance and
sometimes with the profits arising from the abbey lands.</p>
<p>It also shut the door of charity against the impostor, the
helpless, and the idle, who had found here their chief supply; and
gave rise to one of the best laws ever invented by human wisdom
that of each parish supporting its own poor.</p>
<p>By the annihilation of abbots, the church lost its weight in
Parliament, and the vote was thrown into the hands of the temporal
Lords.</p>
<p>It prevented, in some degree, the extinction of families; for,
instead of younger branches becoming the votaries of a monastic
life, they became the votaries of hymen: Hence the kingdom was
enriched by population. It eased the people of a set of masters,
who had for ages ruled them with a rod of iron.</p>
<p>The hands of superstition were also weakened, for the important
sciences of astrology, miracle, and divination, supported by the
cell, have been losing ground ever since.</p>
<p>It likewise recovered vast tracts of land out of dead hands, and
gave an additional vigor to agriculture, unknown to former ages.
The monk, who had only a temporary tenancy, could not give a
permanant one; therefore, the lands were neglected, and the produce
was small: But these lands falling into the hands of the gentry,
acquired an hereditary title. It was their interest; to grant
leases, for a superior rent; and it was the tenant's interest to
give that rent, for the sake of security: Hence the produce of land
is become one of the most advantageous branches of British
commerce.</p>
<p>Henry, by this seisure, had more property to give away, than any
King of England since William the Conqueror, and he generously gave
away that which was never his own. It is curious to survey the
foundation of some of the principal religions that have taken the
lead among men.</p>
<p>Moses founded a religion upon morals and ceremonies, one half of
which continues with his people to this day.</p>
<p>Christ founded one upon <i>love</i> and <i>purity</i>; words of
the simplest import, yet we sometimes mistake their meaning.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Rome erected his, upon deceit and oppression;
hence the treasures of knowledge were locked up, an inundation of
riches and power flowed into the church, with destructive
tendency.</p>
<p>And Henry the Eighth, built his reformation upon revenge and
plunder: He deprived the <i>head</i> of the Romish see, of an
unjust power, for pronouncing a just decision; and robbed the
<i>members</i>, for being annexed to that head. Henry wished the
world to believe, what he believed himself, that he acted from a
religious principle; but his motive seems to have been <i>savage
love</i>.</p>
<p>Had equity directed when Henry divided this vast property, he
would have restored it to the descendants of those persons, whose
mistaken zeal had injured their families; but his disposal of it
was ludicrous--sometimes he made a free gift, at others he
exchanged a better estate for a a worse, and then gave that worse
to another.</p>
<p>I have met with a little anecdote which says, "That Henry being
upon a tour in Devonshire, two men waited on him to beg certain
lands in that county; while they attended in the anti-room for the
royal presence, a stranger approached, and asked them a trifling
question; they answered, they wished to be alone--at that moment
the King entered: They fell at his feet: The stranger seeing them
kneel, kneelt with them. They asked the favor intended; the King
readily granted it: They bowed: The stranger bowed also. By this
time, the stranger perceiving there was a valuable prize in the
question, claimed his thirds; they denied his having anything to do
with the matter: He answered, he had done as much as they, for they
only asked and bowed, and he did the same. The dispute grew warm,
and both parties agreed to appeal to the King, who answered, He
took them for joint beggars, therefore had made them a joint
present. They were then obliged to divide the land with the
stranger, whose share amounted to 240<i>l</i>. per annum."</p>
<p>The land formerly used for the priory of Birmingham, is now the
property of many persons. Upon that spot, whereon stood one
solitary house, now stand about four hundred. Upon that ground,
where about thirty persons lived upon the industry of others, about
three thousand live upon their own: The place, which lay as a heavy
burden upon the community, now tends to enrich it, by adding its
mite to the national commerce, and the national treasury.</p>
<p>In 1775, I took down an old house of wood and plaister, which
had stood 208 years, having been erected in 1567, thirty-one years
after the dissolution of abbies. The foundation of this old house
seemed to have been built chiefly with stones from the priory;
perhaps more than twenty wagon loads: These appeared in a variety
of forms and sizes, highly finished in the gothic taste, parts of
porticos, arches, windows, ceilings, etc. some fluted, some
cyphered, and otherwise ornamented, yet complete as in the first
day they were left by the chizel. The greatest, part of them were
destroyed by the workmen: Some others I used again in the fireplace
of an under kitchen. Perhaps they are the only perfect fragments
that remain of that venerable edifice, which once stood the
monument of ancient piety, the ornament of the town, and the envy
of the priest out of place.</p>

from a person of that name who is said to have lost his life there,
and which, I think, is the only name of antiquity among us.</p>
<p>The particle <i>de</i>, between the christian and surname, is of

<h2><a name="LENCH'S_TRUST."></a>LENCH'S TRUST.</h2>
<br>
<p>In the reign of Henry the Eighth, William Lench, a native of
this place, bequeathed his estate for the purpose of erecting alms
houses, which are those at the bottom of Steelhouse-lane, for the
benefit of poor widows, but chiefly for repairing the streets of
Birmingham. Afterwards others granted smaller donations for the
same use, but all were included under the name of Lench; and I
believe did not unitedly amount, at that time, to fifteen pounds
per annum.</p>
<p>Over this scattered inheritance was erected a trust, consisting
of gentlemen in the neighborhood of Birmingham.</p>
<p>All human affairs tend to confusion: The hand of care is ever
necessary to keep order. The gentlemen, therefore at the head of
this charity, having too many modes of pleasure of their own, to
pay attention to this little jurisdiction, disorder crept in apace;
some of the lands were lost for want of inspection; the rents ran
in arrear, and were never recovered; the streets were neglected,
and the people complained.</p>
<p>Misconduct, particularly of a public nature, silently grows for
years, and sometimes for ages, 'till it becomes too bulky for
support, falls in pieces by its own weight, and out of its very
destruction rises a remedy. An order, therefore, from the Court of
Chancery was obtained, for vesting the property in other hands,
consisting of twenty persons, all of Birmingham, who have directed
this valuable estate, now 227<i>l</i>. 5s. per annum, to useful
purposes. The man who can guide his own private concerns with
success, stands the fairest chance of guiding those of the
public.</p>
<p>If the former trust went widely astray, perhaps their successors
have not exactly kept the line, by advancing the leases to a rack
rent: It is worth considering, whether the tenant of an expiring
lease, hath not in equity, a kind of reversionary right, which
ought to favour him with the refusal of another term, at one third
under the value, in houses, and one fourth in land; this would give
stability to the title, secure the rents, and cause the lessee more
chearfully to improve the premises, which in time would enhance
their value, both with regard to property and esteem.</p>
<p>But where business is well conducted, complaint should cease;
for perfection is not to be expected on this side the grave.</p>
<p>Exclusive of a pittance to the poor widows above, the trust have
a power of distributing money to the necessitous at Christmas and
Easter, which is punctually performed.</p>
<p>I think there is an excellent clause in the devisor's will,
ordering his bailiff to pay half a crown to any two persons, who,
having quarreled and entered into law, shall stop judicial
proceedings, and make peace by agreement--He might have added, "And
half a crown to the lawyer that will suffer them." I know the sum
has been demanded, but am sorry I do <i>not</i> know that it was
ever paid.</p>
<p>If money be reduced to one fourth its value, since the days of
Lench, it follows, that four times the sum ought to be paid in
ours; and perhaps ten shillings cannot be better laid out, than in
the purchase of that peace, which tends to harmonise the community,
and weed a brotherhood not the most amicable among us.</p>

<p>In 1712, George Fentham, of Birmingham, devised his estate by
will, consisting of about one hundred acres, in Erdington and
Handsworth, of the value then, of 20<i>l</i>. per annum, vesting
the same in a trust, of which no person could be chosen who resided
more than one hundred yards from the Old Cross. We should be
inclined to think the devisor entertained a singular predilection
for the Old Cross, then in the pride of youth. But if we unfold
this whimsical clause, we shall find it contains a shrewd
intention. The choice was limited within one hundred yards, because
the town itself, in his day, did not in some directions extend
farther. Fentham had spent a life in Birmingham, knew well her
inhabitants, and like some others, had found honour as well as
riches among them: He knew also, he could with safety deposit his
property in their hands, and was determined it should never go
out,--The scheme will answer his purpose.</p>
<p>The uses of this estate, now about 100<i>l</i>. per annum, are
for teaching children to read, and for clothing ten poor widows of

<br>
<p>It is entertaining to contemplate the generations of fashion,
which not only influences our dress and manner of living, but most
of the common actions of life, and even the modes of thinking. Some
of these fashions, not meeting with the taste of the day, are of
short duration, and retreat out of life as soon as they are well
brought in; others take a longer space; but whatever fashions
predominate, though ever so absurd, they carry an imaginary beauty,
which pleases the fancy, 'till they become ridiculous with age, are
succeeded by others, when their very memory becomes disgusting.</p>
<p>Custom gives a sanction to fashion, and reconciles us even to
its inconveniency. The fashion of this year is laughed at the
next.</p>
<p>There are fashions of every date, from five hundred years, even
to one day; of the first, was that of erecting religious houses; of
the last, was that of destroying them.</p>
<p>Our ancestors, the Saxons, after their conversion to
christianity, displayed their zeal in building churches: though the
kingdom in a few centuries was amply supplied, yet that zeal was no
way abated; it therefore exerted itself in the abbey.--When a man
of fortune had nearly done with time, he began to peep into
eternity through the windows of an abbey; or, if a villian had
committed a piece of butchery, or had cheated the world for sixty
years, there was no doubt but he could burrow his way to glory
through the foundations of an abbey.</p>
<p>In 1383, the sixth of Richard the Second, before the religious
fervor subsided that had erected Deritend-chapel, Thomas de
Sheldon, John Coleshill, John Goldsmith, and William att Slowe, all
of Birmingham, obtained a patent from the crown to erect a building
upon the spot where the Free School now stands in New-street, to be
called <i>The Gild of the Holy Cross</i>; to endow it with lands in
Birmingham and Edgbaston, of the annual value of twenty marks, for
the maintenance of two priests, who were to perform divine service
to the honor of God, our blessed Lady his Mother, the Holy Cross,
St. Thomas, and St. Catharine.</p>
<p>The fashion seemed to take with the inhabitants, many of whom
wished to join the four happy men, who had obtained the patent for
so pious a work; so that, in 1393, a second patent was procured by
the bailiff and inhabitants of Birmingham, for confirming the gild,
and making the addition of a brotherhood in honor of the Holy
Cross, consisting of both sexes, with power to constitute a master
and wardens, and also to erect a chantry of priests to celebrate
divine service in the chapel of the gild, for the souls of the
founders, and all the fraternity; for whose support there were
given, by divers persons, eighteen messuages, three tofts, (pieces
of ground) six acres of land, and forty shillings rent, lying in
Birmingham and Edgbaston aforesaid.</p>
<p>But, in the 27th of Henry the Eighth, 1536, when it was the
fashion of that day, to multiply destruction against the religious,
and their habitations, the annual income of the gild was valued, by
the King's random visitors, at the sum of 31<i>l</i>. 2s. 10d. out
of which, three priests who sung mass, had 5<i>l</i>. 6s. 8d. each;
an organist, 3<i>l</i>. 13s. 4d. the common midwife, 4s. the
bell-man, 6s. 8d. with other salaries of inferior note.</p>
<p>These lands continued in the crown 'till 1552, the fifth of
Edward the Sixth, when, at the humble suit of the inhabitants, they
were assigned to</p>

<p>all inhabitants of Birmingham, and their successors, to be
chosen upon death or removal, by the appellation of the Bailiff and
Governors of the Free Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, for
the instruction of children in grammar; to be held of the crown in
common soccage, paying for ever twenty shillings per annum. Over
this seminary of learning were to preside a master and usher, whose
united income seems to have been only twenty pounds per annum. Both
are of the clergy. The hall of the gild was used for a school-room.
In the glass of the windows was painted the figure of Edmund Lord
Ferrers; who, marrying, about 350 years ago, the heiress of the
house of Birmingham, resided upon the manor, and seems to have been
a benefactor to the gild, with his arms, empaling Belknap; and
also, those of Stafford, of Grafton, of Birmingham, and Bryon.</p>
<p>The gild stood at that time at a distance from the town,
surrounded with inclosures; the highway to Hales Owen, now
New-street, running by the north. No house could be nearer than
those in the High-street.</p>
<p>The first erection, wood and plaister, which had stood about 320
years, was taken down in 1707, to make way for the present flat
building. In 1756, a set of urns were placed upon the parapet,
which give relief to that stiff air, so hurtful to the view: at the
same time, the front was <i>intended</i> to have been decorated, by
erecting half a dozen dreadful pillars, like so many over-grown
giants marshalled in battalia, to guard the entrance, which the
boys wish to shun; and, being sufficiently tarnished with
Birmingham smoak, may become dangerous to pregnancy. Had the wings
of this building fallen two or three yards back, and the line of
the street been preserved by a light palisade, it would have risen
in the scale of beauty, and removed the gloomy aspect of the
area.</p>
<p>The tower is in a good taste, except being rather too narrow in
the base, and is ornamented with a sleepy figure of the donor,
Edward the Sixth, dressed in a royal mantle, with the ensigns of
the Garter; holding a bible and sceptre.</p>
<p>The lands that support this foundation, and were in the reign of
Henry the Eighth, valued at thirty-one pounds per annum, are now,
by the advance of landed property, the reduction of money, and the
increase of commerce, about 600<i>l</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARITY_SCHOOL:"></a>CHARITY SCHOOL:</h2>
<h3>COMMONLY,</h3>
<h3>The BLUE SCHOOL.</h3>
<br>
<p>There seems to be three clases of people, who demand the care of
society; infancy, old age, and casual infirmity. When a man cannot
assist himself, it is necessary he should be assisted. The first of
these only is before us. The direction of youth seems one of the
greatest concerns in moral life, and one that is the least
understood: to form the generation to come, is of the last
importance. If an ingenious master hath flogged the a b c into an
innocent child, he thinks himself worthy of praise. A lad is too
much terrified to march that path, which is marked out by the rod.
If the way to learning abounds with punishment, he will quickly
detest it; if we make his duty a task, we lay a stumbling-block
before him that he cannot surmount.</p>
<p>We rarely know a tutor succeed in training up youth, who is a
friend to harsh treatment.</p>
<p>Whence is it, that we so seldom find affection subsisting
between master and scholar? From the moment they unite, to the end
of their lives, disgust, like a cloud, rises in the mind, which
reason herself can never dispel.</p>
<p>The boy may pass the precincts of childhood, and tread the stage
of life upon an equality with every man in it, except his old
school-master; the dread of him seldom wears off; the name of Busby
founded with horror for half a century after he had laid down the
rod. I have often been delighted when I have seen a school of boys
break up; the joy that diffuses itself over every face and action,
shews infant nature in her gayest form--the only care remaining is,
to forget on one side of the walls what was taught on the
other.</p>
<p>One would think, if <i>coming out</i> gives so much
satisfaction, there must be something very detestable
<i>within</i>.</p>
<p>If the master thinks he has performed his task when he has
taught the boy a few words, he as much mistakes his duty, as he
does the road to learning: this is only the first stage of his
journey. He has the man to form for society with ten thousand
sentiments.</p>
<p>It is curious to enter one of these prisons of science, and
observe the children not under the least government: the master
without authority, the children without order; the master scolding,
the children riotous. We never <i>harden</i> the wax to receive the
impression. They act in a natural sphere, but he in opposition: he
seems the only person in the school who merits correction; he,
unfit to teach, is making them unfit to be taught.</p>
<p>A man does not consider whether his talents are adapted for
teaching, so much, as whether he can <i>profit</i> by teaching:
thus, when a man hath taught for twenty years, he may be only fit
to go to school.</p>
<p>To that vast group of instructors, therefore, whether in, or out
of petticoats, who teach, without having been taught; who mistake
the tail for the feat of learning, instead of the head; who can
neither direct the passions of others nor their own; it may be
said, "Quit the trade, if bread can be procured out of it. It is
useless to pursue a work of error: the ingenious architect must
take up your rotten foundation, before he can lay one that is
solid."</p>
<p>But, to the discerning few, who can penetrate the secret
windings of the heart; who know that nature may be directed, but
can never be inverted; that instruction should ever coincide with
the temper of the instructed, or we sail against the wind; that it
is necessary the pupil should relish both the teacher and the
lesson; which, if accepted like a bitter draught, may easily be
sweetened to his taste: to these valuable few, who, like the
prudent florist, possessed of a choice root, which he cultivates
with care, adding improvement to every generation; it may be said,
"Banish tyranny out of the little dominions over which you are
absolute sovereigns; introduce in its stead two of the highest
ornaments of humanity, love and reason." Through the medium of the
first, the master and the lesson may be viewed without horror; when
the teacher and the learner are upon friendly terms, the scholar
will rather invite than repel the assistance of the master. By the
second, reason, the teacher will support his full authority. Every
period of life in which a man is capable of attending to
instruction, he is capable of attending to reason: this will answer
every end of punishment, and something more.</p>
<p>Thus, an irksome task will be changed into a friendly
intercourse.</p>
<p>This School, by a date in the front, was erected in 1724, in St.
Philip's church-yard; is a plain, airy, and useful building,
ornamented over the door with the figures of a boy and a girl in
the uniform of the school, and executed with a degree of elegance,
that a Roman statuary would not have blushed to own.</p>
<p>This artificial family consists of about ninety scholars, of
both sexes; over which preside a governor and governess, both
single. Behind the apartments, is a large area appropriated for the
amusement of the infant race, necessary as their food. Great
decorum is preserved in this little society; who are supported by
annual contribution, and by a collection made after sermon twice a
year.</p>
<p>At twelve, or fourteen, the children are removed into the
commercial world, and often acquire an affluence that enables them
to support that foundation, which formerly supported them.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that those institutions which are
immediately upheld by the temporary hand of the giver, flourish in
continual spring, and become real benefits to society; while those
which enjoy a perpetual income, are often tinctured with
supineness, and dwindle into obscurity.--The first, usually answer
the purpose of the living; the last, seldom that of the dead.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, the Dissenters established a school,
upon nearly the same plan as the former, consisting of about
eighteen boys and eight girls; with this improvement, that the boys
are innured to moderate labour, and the girls to house-work.</p>
<p>The annual subscriptions seem to be willingly paid, thankfully
received, and judiciously expended.</p>

<br>
<p>During the long reign of the Plantagenets in England, there do
not seem many laws in the code then existing for the regulation of
the poor: distress was obliged to wander for a temporary and
uncertain relief:--idleness usually mixed with it.</p>
<p>The nobility then kept plain and hospitable houses, where want
frequently procured a supply; but, as these were thinly scattered,
they were inadequate to the purpose.</p>
<p>As the abbey was much more frequent, and as a great part of the
riches of the kingdom passed through the hands of the monk, and
charity being consonant to the profession of that order, the weight
of the poor chiefly lay upon the religious houses; this was the
general mark for the indigent, the idle, and the impostor, who
carried meanness in their aspect, and the words <i>Christ Jesus</i>
in their mouth. Hence arise the epithets of stroller, vagrant, and
sturdy beggar, with which modern law is intimately acquainted.</p>
<p>It was too frequently observed, that there was but a slender
barrier between begging and stealing, that necessity seldom marks
the limits of honesty, and that a country abounding with beggars,
abounds also with plunderers. A remnant of this urgent race, so
justly complained of, which disgrace society, and lay the country
under contribution, are still suffered, by the supineness of the
magistrate.</p>
<p>When the religious houses, and all their property, in 1536, fell
a sacrifice to the vindictive wrath of Henry the Eighth, the poor
lost their dependence, and as want knows no law, robbery became
frequent; justice called loudly for punishment, and the hungry for
bread; which gave rise, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, to that
most excellent institution, of erecting every parish into a
distinct fraternity, and obliging them to support their own
members; therefore, it is difficult to assign a reason, why the
blind should go abroad to <i>see</i> fresh countries, or the man
<i>without feet to travel</i>.</p>
<p>Though the poor were nursed by parochial law, yet workhouses did
not become general 'till 1730: that of Birmingham was erected in
1733, at the expence of 1173<i>l</i>. 3s. 5d. and which, the
stranger would rather suppose, was the residence of a gentleman,
than that of four hundred paupers. The left wing, called the
infirmary, was added in 1766, at the charge of 400<i>l</i>. and the
right, a place for labour, in 1779, at the expence of 700<i>l</i>.
more.</p>
<p>Let us a second time, consider the 50,000 people who occupy this
<i>grand toy shop of Europe</i><a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6">[6]</a> as one great family, where, though the
property of individuals is ascertained and secured, yet a close and
beneficial compact subsists. We behold the members of this vast
family marked with every style of character. Forlorn infancy,
accidental calamity, casual sickness, old age, and even inadvertent
distress, all find support from that charitable fund erected by
industry. No part of the family is neglected: he that cannot find
bread for himself, finds a ready supply; he that can, ought to do
so. By cultivating the young suckers of infancy, we prudently
establish the ensuing generation, which will, in the commercial
walk, abundantly repay the expence: temporary affliction of every
kind also merits pity; even those distresses which arise from folly
ought not to be neglected: the parish hath done well to many a man,
who would not do well to himself; if imprudence cannot be banished
out of the world, companion ought not: he that cannot direct
himself, must be under the direction of another.--If the parish
supported none but the prudent, she would have but few to support.
The last stage of human life demands, as well as the first, the
help of the family. The care of infancy arises from an expectation
of a return; that of old age from benefits already received. Though
a man may have passed through life without growing rich, he may, by
his labour, have contributed to make others so; though he could not
pursue the road to affluence himself, he may have been the means of
directing others to find it.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor6">[6]</a>
Burke.</blockquote>
<p>The number of persons depending upon this weekly charity in
Birmingham were, April 14, 1781, about 5240.</p>
<p>Whether the mode of distributing the bounty of the community, is
agreeable to the intentions of legislature, or the ideas of
humanity, is a doubt. For in some parishes the unfortunate paupers
have the additional misery of being sold to a mercenary wretch to
starve upon twelve pence a head. It is matter of surprise that the
magistrate should wink at this cruelty; but it is matter of
pleasure, that no accusation comes within the verge of my
historical remarks, for the wretched of Birmingham are not made
more so by ill treatment, but meet with a kindness acceptable to
distress. One would think <i>that</i> situation could not be
despicable, which is often <i>wished for</i>, and often
<i>sought</i>, that of becoming one of the poor of Birmingham.</p>
<p>We cannot be conversant in parochial business, without observing
a littleness predominant in most parishes, by using every finesse
to relieve themselves of paupers, and throwing them upon others.
Thus the oppressed, like the child between two fathers, is
supported by neither.</p>
<p>There is also an enormity, which, though agreeable to law, can
never be justified by the rules of equity--That a man should spend
the principal part of his life in a parish, add wealth to it by his
labour, form connexions in it, bring up a family which shall all
belong to it, but having never gained a settlement himself, shall,
in old age be removed by an order, to perish among strangers. In
1768, a small property fell into my hands, situated in a
neighbouring village; I found the tenant had entered upon the
premises at the age of twenty-two; that he had resided upon them,
with poverty and a fair character, during the long space of forty
six years--I told him he was welcome to spend the residue of his
life upon the spot gratis. He continued there ten years after, when
finding an inability to procure support from labour, and meeting
with no assistance from the parish in which he had been resident
for an age, he resigned the place with tears, in 1778, after an
occupation of fifty six years, and was obliged to recoil upon his
own parish, about twelve miles distant; to be farmed with the rest
of the poor; and where, he afterwards assured me, "They were
murdering him by inches." -- But no complaint of this ungrateful
kind lies against that people whose character I draw.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be a wise measure, in a place like Birmingham,
where the manufactures flourish in continual sunshine, not to be
over strict with regard to removals. Though it may be burdensome to
support the poor of another parish, yet perhaps it is the least of
two evils: to remove old age which hath spent a life among us, is
ungenerous; to remove temporary sickness, is injurious to trade;
and to remove infancy is impolitic, being upon the verge of
accommodating the town with a life of labour. It may be more
prudent to remove a rascal than a pauper. Forty pounds hath been
spent in removing a family, which would not otherwise have cost
forty shillings, and whose future industry might have added many
times that sum to the common capital. The highest pitch of charity,
is that of directing inability to support itself. Idleness suits no
part of a people, neither does it find a place here; every
individual ought to contribute to the general benefit, by his head
or his hands: if he is arrived at the western verge of life, when
the powers of usefulness decline, let him repose upon his fortune;
if no such thing exists, let him rest upon his friends, and if this
prop fail, let the public nurse him, with a tenderness becoming
humanity.</p>
<p>We may observe, that the manufactures, the laborious part of
mankind, the poor's rates, and the number of paupers, will
everlastingly go hand in hand; they will increase and decrease
together; we cannot annihilate one, but the others will follow, and
odd as the expression may sound, we become rich by payment and
poverty. If we discharge the poor, who shall act the laborious
part? Stop the going out of one shilling, and it will prevent the
coming in of two.</p>
<p>At the introduction of the poor's laws, under Elizabeth, two
pence halfpenny in the pound rent was collected every fortnight,
for future support: time has made an alteration in the system,
which is now six-pence in the pound, and collected as often as
found necessary. The present levy amounts to above 10,000<i>l</i>.
per ann. but is not wholly collected.</p>
<p>As the overseers are generally people of property, payment in
advance is not scrupulously observed.</p>
<p>It was customary, at the beginning of this admirable system of
jurisprudence, to constitute two overseers in each parish; but the
magnitude of Birmingham pleaded for four, which continued 'till the
year 1720, when a fifth was established: in 1729 they were
augmented to half a dozen; the wishes of some, who are frighted at
office, rise to the word <i>dozen</i>, a number very familiar in
the Birmingham art of reckoning: but let it be remembered, that a
vestry filled with overseers is not calculated for the meridian of
business; that the larger the body, the slower the motion; and that
the time and the necessities of the poor demand dispatch.</p>
<p>From the annual disbursements in assisting the poor, which I
shall here exhibit from undoubted evidence, the curious will draw
some useful lessons respecting the increase of manufactures, of
population, and of property.</p>
<p>No memoirs are found prior to 1676.</p>

<p>We cannot pass through this spacious edifice without being
pleased with its internal oeconomy; order influences the whole, nor
can the cleanliness be exceeded: but I am extremely concerned, that
I cannot pass through without complaint.</p>
<p>There are evils in common life which admit of no remedy; but
there are very few which may not be lessened by prudence.</p>
<p>The modes of nursing infancy in this little dominion of poverty,
are truly defective. It is to be feared the method intended to
train up inhabitants for the earth, annually furnishes the regions
of the grave.</p>
<p>Why is so little attention paid to the generation who are to
tread the stage after us? as if we suffered them to be cut off that
we might keep possession for ever. The unfortunate orphan that none
will own, none will regard: distress, in whatever form it appears,
excites compassion, but particularly in the helpless. Whoever puts
an infant into the arms of decrepit old age, passes upon it a
sentence of death, and happy is that infant who finds a reprieve.
The tender sprig is not likely to prosper under the influence of
the tree which attracts its nurture; applies that nurture to
itself, where the calls occasioned by decay are the most
powerful--An old woman and a sprightly nurse, are characters as
opposite as the antipodes.</p>
<p>If we could but exercise a proper care during the first two
years, the child would afterwards nurse itself; there is not a more
active animal in the creation, no part of its time, while awake, is
unemployed: why then do we invert nature, and confine an animal to
still life, in what is called a school, who is designed for
action?</p>
<p>We cannot with indifference behold infants crouded into a room
by the hundred, commanded perhaps by some disbanded soldier, termed
a school-master, who having changed the sword for the rod,
continues much inclined to draw blood with his arms; where every
individual not only re breathes his own air, but that of another:
the whole assembly is composed of the feeble, the afflicted, the
maimed, and the orphan; the result of whose confinement, is a
fallow aspect, and a sickly frame: but the paltry grains of
knowledge gleaned up by the child in this barren field of learning,
will never profit him two-pence in future; whereas, if we could
introduce a robust habit, he would one day be a treasure to the
community, and a greater to himself. Till he is initiated into
labour, a good foundation for health may be laid in air and
exercise.</p>
<p>Whenever I see half a dozen of these forlorn innocents quartered
upon a farm house, a group of them taking the air under the conduct
of a senior, or marshalled in rank and file to attend public
worship, I consider the overseer who directed it, as possessed of
tender feelings: their orderly attire, and simplicity of manners,
convey a degree of pleasure to the mind; and I behold in them, the
future support of that commercial interest; upon which they now lie
as a burden.</p>
<p>If I have dwelt long upon the little part of our species, let it
plead my excuse to say, I cannot view a human being, however
diminutive in stature, or depressed in fortune, without
considering, <i>I view an equal</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="OLD_CROSS,"></a>OLD CROSS,</h2>
<br>
<p>So called, because prior to the Welch Cross; before the erection
of this last, it was simply called, The Cross.</p>
<p>The use of the market cross is very ancient, though not equal to
the market, for this began with civilization.</p>
<p>Christianity first appeared in Britain under the Romans; but in
the sixth century, under the Saxon government, it had made such an
amazing progress, that every man seemed to be not only <i>almost a
Christian</i>, but it was unfashionable not to have been a zealous
one. The cross of Christ was frequently mentioned in conversation,
and afterwards became an oath. It was hacknied about the streets,
sometimes in the pocket, or about the neck; sometimes it was fixed
upon the church, which we see at this day, and always hoisted to
the top of the steeple. The rudiments of learning began with the
cross; hence it stands to this moment as a frontispiece to the
battledore, which likewise bears its name.</p>
<p>This important article of religion was thought to answer two
valuable purposes, that of collecting the people; and containing a
charm against ghosts, evil spirits, etc. with the idea of which,
that age was much infested.</p>
<p>To accomplish these singular ends, it was blended into the
common actions of life, and at that period it entered the
market-place. A few circular steps from the centre of which issued
an elevated pillar, terminating in a cross, was the general fashion
throughout the kingdom; and perhaps our Vulcanian ancestors knew no
other for twelve hundred years, this being renewed about once every
century, 'till the year 1702, when the present cross was erected,
at the expence of 80<i>l</i>. 9s. 1d. This was the first upon that
spot, ever honoured with a roof: the under part was found a useful
shelter for the market-people. The room over it was designed for
the court leet, and other public business, which during the
residence of the lords upon the manor, had been transacted in one
of their detached apartments, yet in being: but after the removal
of the lords, in 1537, the business was done in the Leather-hall,
which occupied the whole east end of New-street, a covered gateway
of twelve feet excepted, and afterwards in the Old Cross.</p>

<h2><a name="WELCH_CROSS."></a>WELCH CROSS.</h2>
<br>
<p>If a reader, fond of antiquity, should object, that I have
comprized the <i>Ancient state of Birmingham</i> in too small a
compass, and that I ought to have extended it beyond the 39th page;
I answer, when a man has not much to say, he ought to be hissed out
of authorship, if he picks the pocket of his friend, by saying
much; neither does antiquity end with that page, for in some of the
chapters, I have led him through the mazes of time, to present him
with a modern prospect.</p>
<p>In erecting a new building, we generally use the few materials
of the old, as far as they will extend. Birmingham may be
considered as one vast and modern edifice, of which the ancient
materials make but a very small part: the extensive <i>new</i>,
seems to surround the minute <i>old</i>, as if to protect it.</p>
<p>Upon the spot where the Welch Cross now stands, probably stood a
finger-post, to direct the stranger that could read, for there were
not many, the roads to Wolverhampton and Lichfield.</p>
<p>Though the ancient post, and the modern cross, might succeed
each other, yet this difference was between them, one stood at a
distance from the town, the other stands near its centre.</p>
<p>By some antique writings it appears, that 200 years ago this
spot bore the name of the Welch End, perhaps from the number of
Welch in its neighbourhood; or rather, from its being the great
road to that principality, and was at that time the extremity of
the town, odd houses excepted. This is corroborated by a
circumstance I have twice mentioned already, that when Birmingham
unfortunately fell under the frowns of Prince Rupert, 137 years
ago, and he determined to reduce it to ashes for succouring an
enemy, it is reasonable to suppose he began at the exterior, which
was then in Bull-street, about twelve houses above the cross.</p>
<p>If we were ignorant of the date of this cross, the style of the
building itself would inform us, that it rose in the beginning of
the present century, and was designed, as population encreased, for
a Saturday market; yet, although it is used in some degree for that
purpose, the people never heartily adopted the measure.</p>
<p>In a town like Birmingham, a commodious market-place, for we
have nothing that bears the name, would be extremely useful.
Efforts have been used to make one, of a large area, now a
bowling-green, in Corbet's-alley; but I am persuaded the
market-people would suffer the grass to grow in it, as peaceably as
in their own fields. We are not easily drawn from ancient custom,
except by interest.</p>
<p>For want of a convenient place where the sellers may be
collected into one point, they are scattered into various parts of
the town. Corn is sold by sample, in the Bull-ring; the eatable
productions of the garden, in the same place: butchers stalls
occupy Spiceal-street; one would think a narrow street was
preferred, that no customer should be suffered to pass by. Flowers,
shrubs, etc. at the ends of Philip-street and Moor-street: beds of
earthen-ware lie in the middle of the foot ways; and a double range
of insignificant stalls, in the front of the shambles, choak up the
passage: the beast market is kept in Dale-end: that for pigs, sheep
and horses in New-street: cheese issues from one of our principal
inns: fruit, fowls and butter are sold at the Old Cross: nay, it is
difficult to mention a place where they are not. We may observe, if
a man hath an article to sell which another wants to buy, they will
quickly find each other out.</p>
<p>Though the market-inconveniencies are great, a man seldom brings
a commodity for the support of life, or of luxury, and returns
without a customer. Yet even this crowded state of the market,
dangerous to the feeble, hath its advantages: much business is
transacted in a little time; the first customer is obliged to use
dispatch, before he is justled out by a second: to <i>stand all the
day idle in the market place</i>, is not known among us.</p>
<p>The upper room of this cross is appropriated for a military
guard-house. We find, December 16, 1723, an order made at a public
meeting, that "A guard house should be erected in a convenient part
of the town, because neither of the crosses were eligible." But
this old order, like some of the new, was never carried into
execution. As no complaint lies against the cross, in our time, we
may suppose it suitable for the purpose; and I know none but its
prisoners that pronounce against it.</p>

<h2><a name="SAINT_MARTIN's."></a>SAINT MARTIN's.</h2>
<br>
<p>It has been remarked, that the antiquity of this church is too
remote for historical light.</p>
<p>The curious records of those dark ages, not being multiplied,
and preserved by the art of printing, have fallen a prey to time,
and the revolution of things.</p>
<br>
<a name="image15.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/image15.jpg"><img src=
"images/image15.jpg" width="45%" alt=""></a><br>
<b><i>Saint Martin's Church</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>There is reason for fixing the foundation in the eighth century,
perhaps rather sooner, and it then was at a small distance from the
buildings. The town stood upon the hill, whose centre was the Old
Cross; consequently, the ring of houses that now surrounds the
church, from the bottom of Edgbaston-street, part of
Spiceal-street, the Bull-ring, Corn-cheaping, and St.
Martin's-lane, could not exist.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think that the precincts of St. Martin's have
undergone a mutilation, and that the place which has obtained the
modern name of Bull-ring, and which is used as a market for corn
and herbs, was once an appropriation of the church, though not used
for internment; because the church is evidently calculated for a
town of some size, to which the present church-yard no way agrees,
being so extremely small that the ancient dead must have been
continually disturbed, to make way for the modern, that little spot
being their only receptacle for 900 years.</p>
<p>A son not only succeeds his father in the possession of his
property and habitation, but also in the grave, where he can
scarcely enter without expelling half a dozen of his ancestors.</p>
<p>The antiquity of St. Martin's will appear by surveying the
adjacent ground. From the eminence upon which the High-street
stands, proceeds a steep, and regular descent into Moor-street,
Digbeth, down Spiceal-street, Lee's-lane, and Worcester-street.
This descent is broken only by the church-yard; which, through a
long course of internment, for ages, is augmented into a
considerable hill, chiefly composed of the refuse of life. We may,
therefore, safely remark, in this place, <i>the dead are raised
up</i>. Nor shall we be surprised at the rapid growth of the hill,
when we consider this little point of land was alone that hungry
grave which devoured the whole inhabitants, during the long ages of
existence, till the year 1715, when St. Philip's was opened. The
curious observer will easily discover, the fabric has lost that
symmetry which should ever attend architecture, by the growth of
the soil about it, causing a low appearance in the building, so
that instead of the church burying the dead, the dead would, in
time, have buried the church.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to allow, the original approach into this place
was by a flight of steps, not by descent, as is the present case;
and that the church-yard was surrounded by a low wall. As the
ground swelled by the accumulation of the dead, wall after wall was
added to support the growing soil; thus the fence and the hill
sprang up together; but this was demonstrated, August 27, 1781,
when, in removing two or three old houses, to widen St. Martin's
Lane, they took down the church-yard wall, which was fifteen feet
high without, and three within. This proved to be only an outward
case, that covered another wall twelve feet high; in the front of
which was a stone, elevated eight feet, and inscribed, "Robert
Dallaway, Francis Burton." Church-wardens, anno dom. (supposed)
"1310." As there is certain evidence, that the church is, much
older then the above date, we should suspect there had been another
fence many ages prior to this. But it was put beyond a doubt, when
the workmen came to a third wall, four feet high, covered with
antique coping, probably erected with the fabric itself, which
would lead us far back into the Saxon times.</p>
<p>The removal of the buildings to accommodate the street, the
construction of the wall, beautified with pallisades, is
<i>half</i> an elegant plan, well executed. If we can persuade
ourselves to perform the other half, by removing the remainder of
the buildings, and continuing the line to the steps, at the bottom
of Spiceal-street, the work will stand in the front of modern
improvement.</p>
<p>In the south-east part of the wall, covered by the engine-house,
upon another stone, nearly obliterated, is, John Enser, Richard
Higginson, Church-wardens, 1709.</p>
<p>Other church-yards are ornamented with the front of the
buildings, but that of St. Martin submits to the rear.</p>
<p>The present church is of stone; the first upon the premises; and
perhaps the oldest building in these parts.</p>
<p>As the country does not produce stone of a lasting texture, and
as the rough blasts of 900 years, had made inroads upon the fabric,
it was thought necessary, in 1690, to case both church and steeple
with brick, except the spire, which is an elegant one. The bricks
and the workmanship are excellent.</p>
<p>Though the fabric is not void of beauty, yet being closely
surrounded with houses, which destroy the medium of view, that
beauty is totally hid.</p>
<p>The steeple has, within memory, been three times injured by
lightning. Forty feet of the spire, in a decayed state, was taken
down and rebuilt in 1781, with stone from Attleborough, near
Nuneaton; and strengthened by a spindle of iron, running up its
centre 105 feet long, secured to the side walls every ten feet, by
braces--the expence, 165<i>l</i>. 16s.</p>
<p>Inclosed is a ring of twelve musical bells, and though I am not
master of the bob major and tripple-grandfire, yet am well
informed, the ringers are masters of the bell-rope: but to excel in
Birmingham is not new.</p>
<p>The seats in the church would disgrace a meaner parish than that
of Birmingham; one should be tempted to think, they are the first
ever erected upon the spot, without taste or order: the timber is
become hard with age, and to the honour of the inhabitants, bright
with use. Each sitting is a private freehold, and is farther
disgraced, like the coffin of a pauper, with the paltry initials of
the owner's name. These divine abodes are secured with the coarse
padlocks of a field gate.</p>
<p>By an attentive survey of the seats, we plainly discover the
increasing population of Birmingham. When the church was erected,
there was doubtless sufficient room for the inhabitants, and it was
probably the only place for public worship during 800 years: as the
town increased, gallery after gallery was erected, 'till no
conveniency was found for more. Invention was afterwards exerted to
augment the number of sittings; every recess capable only of
admitting the body of an infant, was converted into a seat, which
indicates, the continual increase of people, and, that a spirit of
devotion was prevalent among them.</p>
<p>The floor of the church is greatly injured by internment, as is
also the light, by the near approach of the buildings,
notwithstanding, in 1733, the middle roof of the chancel was taken
off, and the side walls raised about nine feet, to admit a double
range of windows.</p>
<p>Dugdale, who wrote in 1640, gives us twenty-two drawings of the
arms, in the windows, of those gentry who had connection with
Birmingham.</p>

<p>These twenty-two coats are now reduced to three, which are,</p>
<p>Number two, in the east window of the chancel, which is <i>or,
two lions passant azure</i>, the arms of the family of Someri,
Lords of Dudley-castle, and superior Lords of Birmingham; which
having been extinct about 450 years, the coat of arms must have
been there at least during that period.</p>
<p>Number three, in the south window of the chancel, <i>azure, a
bend lozenge of five points, or</i>, the ancient arms of the family
of Birmingham, which perhaps is upwards of 400 years old, as that
coat was not used after the days of Edward the First, except in
quarterings.</p>
<p>And number ten, in the north window, <i>or, a cross, indented
gules</i>; also, <i>five fleurs de lis</i>, the ancient arms of
Freville, Lords of Tamworth, whose ancestor, Marmion, received a
grant of that castle from William the Conqueror, and whose
descendant, Lord Viscount Townshend, is the present proprietor.
Perhaps this coat hath been there 400 years, for the male line of
the Freville family, was extinct in the reign of Henry the
Fourth.</p>
<p>Under the south window of the chancel, by the door, are two
monuments a-breast, of white marble, much injured by the hand of
rude time, and more by that of the ruder boys. The left figure,
which is very ancient, I take to be William de Birmingham, who was
made prisoner by the French, at the siege of Bellegard, in the 25th
of Edward the First, 1297. He wears a short mantle, which was the
dress of that time, a sword, expressive of the military order, and
he also bears a shield with the bend lozenge, which seems never to
have been borne after the above date.</p>
<p>The right hand figure, next the wall, is visibly marked with a
much older date, perhaps about the conquest. The effigy does not
appear in a military character, neither did the Lords of that
period. The value of these ancient relicts have long claimed the
care of the wardens, to preserve them from the injurious hand of
the boys, and the foot of the window cleaner, by securing them with
a pallisade. Even Westminster abbey, famous for departed glory,
cannot produce a monument of equal antiquity.</p>
<p>At the foot of these, is another of the same materials,
belonging to one of the Marrows, Lords of Birmingham.</p>
<p>Under the north east window, is a monument of white marble,
belonging to one of the Lords of the house of Birmingham: but this
is of modern date compared with the others, perhaps not more than
300 years; he bearing the <i>parte per pale, indented or, and
gules</i>.</p>
<p>In the church is an excellent organ, and in the steeple a set of
chimes, where the ingenious artist treats us with a fresh tune
every day of the week.</p>

<br>
<p>Whereas the church of St. Martin's, in Birmingham, had only 52
ounces of plate, in 1708, for the use of the communion table; it
was, by a voluntary subscription of the inhabitants, increased to
275--Two flaggons, two cups, two covers and pattens, with cases:
the whole, 80<i>l</i>. 16s. 6d.</p>
<p>Richard Banner ordered one hundred pounds to be laid out in
lands within ten miles of Birmingham; which sum, lying at interest,
and other small donations being added, amounted to 170<i>l</i>.
with which an estate at Erdington, value 81. 10s. per annum, was
purchased for the poor of Birmingham.</p>
<p>Richard Kilcup gave a house and garden at Spark-brook, for the
church and poor.</p>
<p>John Cooper gave a croft for making of love-days (merriments)
among Birmingham men.</p>
<p>William Rixam gave a house in Spiceal-street, No. 26, for the

<p>John Ward, in 1591, gave a house and lands in Marston Culey.</p>
<p>William Colmore gave ten shillings per ann. payable out of the

<p>John Shelton gave ten shillings per annum, issuing out of a
house occupied by Martin Day.</p>
<p>Several of the above donations are included in Lench's
trust.</p>
<p>John Peak gave a chest bound with iron for the use of the
church; seemingly about 200 years old, and of 200 lb. weight.</p>
<p>Edward Smith gave 20<i>l</i>. per ann. to the poor, in 1612, and
also erected the pulpit.</p>
<p>John Billingsley, in 1629, gave 26 shillings yearly, chargeable
upon a house in Dale-end, to be given in bread, by six-pence every
Sunday.</p>
<p>One croft to find bell-ropes.</p>
<p>Richard Dukesayle, in 1630, gave the utensils belonging to the

<p>Barnaby Smith, 1633, gave 20<i>l</i>. to be lent to ten poor
tradesmen, at the discretion of the church-wardens for two or three
years.</p>
<p>Catharine Roberts, wife of Barnaby Smith, in 1642, gave
20<i>l</i>. the interest of which was to be given to the poor, the
first Friday in Lent.</p>
<p>John Jennens, 1651, gave 2<i>l</i>. 10s. for the use of the
poor, born and living in Birmingham; and also 20s. on St. Thomas's
day.</p>
<p>John Milward gave 26<i>l</i> per annum, lying in Bordesley: one
third to the school-master of Birmingham, (Free-school); one third
to the Principal of Brazen nose College, Oxford, for the
maintenance of one scholar from Birmingham or Haverfordwest, and
the remainder to the poor.</p>
<p>Joseph Pemberton gave 40s. per annum, payable out of an estate
at Tamworth, and 20s. out of an estate in Harbourne.</p>
<p>Richard Smallbrook gave to the poor of Birmingham 10s. per
annum, arising out of a salt vat in Droitwich.</p>
<p>Robert Whittall gave the pall, or beere cloth.</p>
<p>Widow Cooper, of the Talbot, No. 20, in High-street, gave one
towel and one sheet, to wrap the poor in the grave.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jennens gave 10<i>l</i>. per annum to support a lecture,
the second and third Thursday in every month.</p>
<p>The following offspring of charity seems to have expired at its
birth, but rose from the dead a few months ago, after an internment
of fifty-four years.</p>
<p>The numerous family of Piddock flourished in great opulence for
many ages, and though they were not lords of a manor, they were as
rich as those who were: they yet boast, that their ancestors could
walk seven miles upon their own land. It sometimes may be prudent,
however, to believe only <i>half</i> what a man says; besides, a
person with tolerable vigour of limb, might contrive to walk seven
miles upon his own land, if he has but one acre--a lawyer is not
the only man who can double.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were possessed of the northern part of this parish,
from Birmingham-heath to Shirland-brook, exclusive of many estates
in the manors of Smethwick and Oldbury.</p>
<p>Their decline continued many years, till one of them, in 1771,
extinguished their greatness by a single dash of his pen, in
selling the last foot of land.--I know some of them now in
distress.</p>
<p>William Piddock, in 1728, devised his farm at Winson-green,
about nine acres, to his wife Sarah, during life, and at her death,
to his nephews and executors William and John Riddall, their heirs
and assigns for ever, in trust, for educating and putting out poor
boys of Birmingham; or other discretional charities in the same
parish.</p>
<p>But William and John wisely considered, that they could not put
the money into any pocket sooner than their own; that as the estate
was in the family it was needless to disturb it; that as the will
was not known to the world, there was no necessity to publish it;
and, as it gave them a discretional power of disposal, they might
as well consider themselves <i>the poor</i>, for they were both in
the parish.</p>
<p>There is nothing easier than to coin excuses for a fault;--there
is nothing harder than to make them pass.</p>
<p>What must be his state of mind, who is in continual
apprehensions of a disgraceful discovery? No profits can compensate
his feelings.</p>
<p>Had the deviser been less charitable, William and John had been
less guilty: the gift of one man becomes a temptation to another.
These nine acres, from which the donor was to spring upwards, lay
like a mountain on the breasts of William and John, tending to
press them downwards. Although poverty makes many a rogue, yet had
William and John been more poor, they would have been more
innocent. The children themselves would have been the least gainers
by the bequest, for, without this legacy, they could just as well
have procured trades; the profit would have centered in the
inhabitants, by softening their levies.--Thus a donation runs
through many a private channel, unseen by the giver.</p>
<p>Matters continued in this torpid state till 1782, when a quarrel
between the brothers and a tenant, broke the enchantment, and
shewed the actors in real view.</p>
<p>The officers, in behalf of the town, filed a bill in Chancery,
and recovered the dormant property, which was committed in trust
to</p>

<p>During Cromwell's government, ---- Slater, a broken apothecary
of this place, having been unsuccessful in curing the body,
resolved to attempt curing the soul. He therefore, to repair his
misfortunes, assumed the clerical character, and cast an eye on the
rectory of St. Martin's; but he had many powerful opponents: among
others were Jennens, an iron-master, possessor of Aston-furnace;
Smallbroke, another wealthy inhabitant, and Sir Thomas Holt.</p>
<p>However, he with difficulty, triumphed over his enemies, stept
into the pulpit, and held the rectory till the restoration.</p>
<p>Being determined, in his first sermon, to lash his enemies with
the whip of those times, he told his people, "The Lord had carried
him through many troubles; for he had passed, like Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, through the <i>fiery furnace</i>. And as the
Lord had enabled the children of Israel to pass over the Red Sea,
so he had assisted him in passing over the <i>Small-brooks</i>, and
to overcome the strong <i>Holts</i> of sin and satan."</p>
<p>At the restoration, suspecting the approach of the proper
officers to expel him from the Parsonage-house, he crept into a
hiding-place under the stairs; but, being discovered, was drawn out
by force, and the place ever after, bore the name of <i>Slater's
Hole</i>.</p>
<p>John Riland succeeded him, who is celebrated for piety,
learning, and a steady adherence to the interest of Charles the
First; in whose cause he seems to have lost every thing he
possessed, but his life. He was remarkable for compromising
quarrels among his neighbours, often at an expence to himself; also
for constantly carrying a charity box, to relieve the distress of
others; and, though robbed of all himself, never thought he was
poor, except when his box was empty.--He died in 1672, aged 53.</p>
<p>A succeeding rector, William Daggett, is said to have understood
the art of boxing, better than that of preaching: his clerk often
felt the weightier argument of his hand. Meeting a quaker, whose
profession, then in infancy, did not stand high in esteem, he
offered some insults, which the other resenting, told him, "If he
was not protected by his cloth, he would make him repent the
indignity." Dagget immediately stripped, "There, now I have thrown
off my protection."</p>
<p>They fought--but the spiritual bruiser proved too hard for the
injured quaker.</p>
<p>Among the rectors we sometimes behold a magistrate; at others,
those who for misconduct ought to have been taken before one.</p>
<p>The rectory, in the King's books, was valued, in 1291, at
5<i>l</i>. per annum; and, in 1536, at 19<i>l</i>. 3s. 6d.</p>

<p>From the above terrier, I am inclined to value the income at
about 90<i>l</i>. per annum.</p>
<p>The benefice, in 1771, was about 350<i>l</i>. per annum: the
late Rector, John Parsons, procured an act, in 1773, to enable the
incumbent to grant building leases; the grant of a single lease, in
1777, brought the annual addition of about 170<i>l</i>. The income
is now about 700<i>l</i>. and is expected, at the expiration of the
leases, to exceed 2000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The repairs of the chancel belong to the rector, and the
remainder of the building to the parish.</p>

<h2><a name="SAINT_PHILLIP's."></a>SAINT PHILLIP's.</h2>
<br>
<p>We have touched upon various objects in our peregrinations
through Birmingham, which meet with approbation, though viewed
through the medium of smoke; some of these, being covered with the
rust of time, command our veneration; but the prospect before us is
wholly modern.</p>
<p>We have mounted, by imperceptable gradations, from beauty to
beauty, 'till we are now arrived at the summit.</p>
<p>If an historian had written in the last century, he would have
recorded but two places of worship; I am now recording the
fourteenth: but my successor, if not prevented by our own
imprudence, in driving away the spirit of commerce, may record the
four-and-twentieth. The artist, who carries the manufactures among
foreigners, or the overseer, who wantonly loads the people with
burdens, draws the wrath of the place upon his own head.</p>
<p>This curious piece of architecture, the steeple of which is
erected after the model of St. Paul's, in London, but without its
weight, does honour to the age that raised it, and to the place
that contains it. Perhaps the eye of the critic cannot point out a
fault, which the hand of the artist can mend: perhaps too, the
attentive eye cannot survey this pile of building, without
communicating to the mind a small degree of pleasure. If the
materials are not proof against time, it is rather a misfortune to
be lamented, than an error to be complained of, the country
producing no better.</p>
<p>Yet, amidst all the excellencies we boast, I am sorry to charge
this chief ornament with an evil which admits no cure, that of not
ranging with its own coemetery, or the adjacent buildings: out of
seven streets, with which it is connected, it lines with
none.--Like Deritend chapel, of which I have already complained,
from a strong attachment to a point of religion, or of the compass,
it appears twisted out of its place. We may be delighted with a
human figure, complete in stature, exactly moulded with symmetry,
and set off with the graces of dress; but we should be disgusted,
if his right side seemed to attempt to out-walk his left.</p>
<p>This defect, in religious architecture, arises from a strict
adherence to the custom of the ancients, who fixed their altars
towards the east. It is amasing, that even weakness itself, by long
practice, becomes canonical; it gains credit by its age and its
company. Hence, Sternhold and Hopkins, by being long bound up with
scripture, acquired a kind of scripture authority.</p>
<p>The ground, originally, was part of a farm, and bore the name of
the Horse-close; afterwards <i>Barley-close</i>.--Thus a benign
spot of earth, gave additional spirits to a man when living, and
kindly covered him in its bosom when dead.</p>
<p>This well chosen spot, is the summit of the highest eminence in
Birmingham, with a descent every way; and, when the church was
erected, there were not any buildings nearer than those in
Bull-street.</p>
<p>The land was the gift of Robert Phillips, Esq; whence the name,
ancestor to William Theodore Inge, Esquire.</p>
<p>In all degrees of people, from the bishop to the beadle, there
seems a propensity in the mind to arrive at the honours of
Sainthood: by joining our names in partnership with a faint, we
share with him a red letter in the almanack.</p>
<p>Out of six churches in Birmingham, three bear the names of the
donors. St. Bartholomew's would, probably, have taken that of its
founder, John Jennens, Esq; but that name happened to be
anticipated by Sir John de Birmingham, who conferred it upon
Deritend chapel. St. Mary's could readily perpetuate the name of
its benefactress, because we had no place of worship that bore it.
But as neither the popish, nor the protestant kalendar produced a
St. Charles, the founder of St. Paul's was unfortunately
excluded.</p>
<p>The gifts, which the benefactor himself believes are charitable,
and expects the world to believe the same, if scrutinized, will be
found to originate from various causes--counterfeits are apt to be
offered in currency for sterling.</p>
<p>Perhaps <i>ostentation</i> has brought forth more acts of
beneficence than charity herself; but, like an unkind parent, she
disowns her offspring, and charges them upon charity.</p>
<p>Ostentation is the root of charity; why else are we told, in
capitals, by a large stone in the front of a building--"This
hospital was erected by William Bilby, in the sixty-third year of
his age, 1709." Or, "That John Moore, yeoman, of Worley Wigorn,
built this school, in 1730."--Nay, pride even tempts us to strut in
a second-hand robe of charity, left by another; or why do we
read--"These alms-houses were erected by Lench's trust, in 1764. W.
WALSINGHAM, BAILIFF."</p>
<p>Another utters the word <i>charity</i>, and we rejoice in the
echo. If we miss the substance, we grasp at the shadow.</p>
<p>Sometimes we assign our property for religious uses, late in the
evening of life, when <i>enjoyment</i> is over, and almost
<i>possession</i>. Thus we bequeath to piety, what we can keep no
longer. We convey our name to posterity at the expence of our
successor, and scaffold our way towards heaven up the walls of a
steeple.</p>
<p>Will charity chalk up one additional score in our favour,
because we grant a small portion of our land to found a church,
which enables us to augment the remainder treble its value, by
granting building leases? a man seldom makes a bargain for heaven,
and forgets himself. Charity and self-interest, like the apple and
the rind, are closely connected, and, like them, we cannot separate
one without trespassing on the other.</p>
<p>In contributions of the lesser kind, the giver examines the
quantum given by those of his own station; <i>pride</i> will not
suffer him to appear less than his neighbour.</p>
<p>Sometimes he surrenders merely through importunity, which
indicates as much <i>charity</i>, as the garrison does
<i>merit</i>, which surrenders when closely besieged. Neither do we
fear <i>our left hand knowing what our right hand doth</i>, our
only fear is, left the world should <i>not</i> know it.</p>
<p>This superb edifice was begun by act of Parliament, in 1711,
under a commission consisting of twenty of the neighbouring gentry,
appointed by the bishop of the diocese, under his episcopal seal.
Their commission was to end twelve months after the erection of the
church.</p>
<p>Though Birmingham ever was, and perhaps ever will be considered
as one parish, yet a portion of land, about one hundred acres,
nearly triangular, and about three fourths built up, was taken out
of the centre of St. Martin's, like a shred of cloth out of a great
coat, to make a less, and constituted a separate parish, by the
appellation of St Philip's.</p>
<p>We shall describe this new boundary by an imaginary journey, for
a real one perhaps was never taken since the land was first laid
out, nor ever will to the end of time.</p>
<p>We include the warehouse, then of John Jenens, Esq; now No. 26,
in High-street, penetrate through the buildings, till we come
within twenty yards, of Moor-street, turn sharp to the left, cross
the lower part of Castle-street, Carr's-lane, and New
Meeting-street; pass close by the front of the Meeting-house,
through Bank-alley, into Hen's-walk, having kept Moor-street about
twenty yards to the right, all the way; we now enter that street,
at the bottom of Hen's-walk, pass through the east part of
Dale-end, through Stafford-street, Steelhouse-lane (then called
Whittal-lane) Bull-lane (then New-hall-lane) and
Mount-pleasant.</p>
<p>Our journey now leads us on the west of Pinfold-street, keeping
it about twenty yards on our left; up Peck-lane, till we come near
the top, when we turn to the right, keeping the buildings, with the
Free-school in New street, on our left, into Swan-alley. We now
turn up the Alley into New-street, then to the right, which leads
us to the Party-wall, between No. 25 and 26, in High-street, late
Jennens's, where we began.</p>
<p>In the new parish I have described, and during the journey, kept
on the left, there seems to have been, at passing the act, twelve
closes, all which are filled with buildings, except the land
between New-street and Mount-pleasant, which only waits a word from
the owner, to speak the houses into being.</p>
<p>The church was consecrated in 1715, and finished in 1719, the
work of eight years; at which time the commissioners resigned their
powers into the hands of the diocesan, in whom is the presentation,
after having paid, it is said, the trifling sum of
5012<i>l</i>.--but perhaps such a work could not be completed for
20,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Three reasons may be assigned, why so small a sum was expended;
many of the materials were given; more of the carriage, and some
heavy debts were contracted.</p>
<p>The urns upon the parapet of the church, which are highly
ornamental, were fixed at the same time with those of the school,
in about 1756.</p>
<p>When I first saw St. Philip's, in the year 1741, at a proper
distance, uncrowded with houses, for there were none to the north,
New-hall excepted, untarnished with smoke, and illuminated by a
western sun, I was delighted with its appearance, and thought it
then, what I do now, and what others will in future, <i>the pride
of the place</i>.</p>
<p>If we assemble the beauties of the edifice, which cover a rood
of ground; the spacious area of the church-yard, occupying four
acres; ornamented with walks in great perfection; shaded with trees
in double and treble ranks; and surrounded with buildings in
elegant taste: perhaps its equal cannot be found in the British
dominions.</p>
<p>The steeple, 'till the year 1751, contained a peal of six bells,
which were then augmented to ten; at which time St. Martin's, the
mother church, having only eight, could not bear to be out-numbered
by a junior, though of superior elegance, therefore ordered twelve
into her own steeple: but as room was insufficient for the
admission of bells by the dozen, means were found to hoist them
tier over tier. Though the round dozen is a complete number in the
counting-house, it is not altogether so in the belfry: the octave
is the most perfect concord in music, but diminishes by rising to
an octave and a half; neither can that dozen well be crowded into
the peal.</p>
<p>But perhaps the artist had another grand scheme in view, that of
accommodating the town with the additional harmony of the chimes;
for only a few tunes can be played on the octave, whilst the dozen
will compass nearly all.</p>
<p>Whether we are entertained even by this <i>exalted</i> style of
music, admits a doubt; for instead of the curious ear being charmed
with distinct notes, we only hear a bustle of confused sounds,
which baffle the attention too much to keep pace with the tune.</p>
<p>These two steeples, are our <i>public</i> band of music: they
are the only <i>standing</i> Waits of the place. Two thousand
people may be accommodated in the church, but, at times, it has
contained near three thousand.</p>
<p>In the vestry is a theological library, bequeathed by the first
rector, William Higgs, for the use of the clergy in Birmingham and
its neighbourhood; who left 200<i>l</i>. for future purchase.</p>
<p>Under the centre isle runs a vault, the whole length of the
church, for the reception of those who chuse to pay an additional
guinea.</p>
<p>The organ excels; the paintings, mouldings and gildings are
superb: whether the stranger takes an external or an internal
survey, the eye is struck with delight, and he pronounces the whole
the work of a matter. Its conveniency also, can only be equalled by
its elegance.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2>In the FRONT GALLERY.</h2>
<br>
<p>Upon application of Sir Richard Gough, to Sir Robert Walpole,
then in power, George the First gave 600<i>l</i>. in 1725, towards
finishing this church.</p>
<p>Three remarks naturally arise from this declaration; That the
prodigious sums expended upon this pious undertaking, were beyond
the ability of the inhabitants; that the debts contracted, were
many years in discharging; and that one of the best of Kings, the
head of the Brunswick line, bestowed a liberal benefaction upon a
people not compleatly reconciled to his house.</p>
<p>Whether monumental decoration adds beauty to a place already
beautiful, is a question. There are three very small and very
elegant monuments in this church. Upon one of the south pillars, is
that of the above William Higgs, who died in 1733. Upon another is
that of William Vyse, the second rector, who died in 1770, at the
age of 61. And, upon a north pillar, that of Girton Peak, Esq; an
humane magistrate, who died in 1770, aged 48.</p>
<p>Internment in the church is wisely prohibited; an indecency
incompatible with a civilized people. The foreigner will be apt to
hold forth the barbarity of the English nation, by observing, "They
introduce corruption in their very churches, and pay divine
adoration upon the graves of their ancestors."</p>
<p>Places of worship were designed for the living, the dead give up
their title with their life: besides, even small degrees of
putrefaction, confined in a room where the air cannot circulate,
may become prejudicial to health: it also ruins the pavement, as is
done at St. Martin's. Our first inhabitants, therefore, lie
contented in the church yard, by their unfortunate equals; having
private sepulchres appropriated for family use--Perhaps at the last
day, no inquiry will be made whether they lay on the in, or the
outside of the walls.</p>
<p>It is difficult to traverse the elegant walks that surround this
gulf of death, without contemplating, that time is drawing us
towards the same focus, and that we shall shortly fall into the
centre: that this irregular circle contains what was once generous
and beautiful, opulent and humane. The arts took their rise in this
fruitful soil: this is the grave of invention and of industry; here
those who figured upon the stage are fallen, to make way for
others, who must follow: though multitudes unite with the dead, the
numbers of the living increase; the inhabitants change, while the
genius improves. We cannot pass on without reading upon the stones,
the short existence of our departed friends, perusing the end of a
life with which we were well acquainted. The active motion that
veered with the rude blasts of seventy years, slops in this point
for ever.</p>
<p>The present rector, who is the third, is the Rev. Charles
Newling, and the benefice something like the following:</p>

<h2><a name="BIRTHS_AND_BURIALS."></a>BIRTHS AND BURIALS.</h2>
<br>
<p>There are many inducements for an author to take up the pen, but
the leading motives, however disguised, seem to be pride and
poverty; hence, two of the most despicable things among men,
furnish the world with knowledge.</p>
<p>One would think, however, there can be no great inducement for a
man to write what he is conscious will never be read. Under this
class may be comprehended alphabetical collections, chronological
tables, books of figures, occasional devotions, etc. here also I
range the lists of officers in Birmingham, the annual sums expended
upon the poor, and the present chapter of numbers. These are
intended for occasional inspection, rather than for regular
perusal: we may consider them as deserts served up for a taste
only, not a dinner; yet even this rule may be broken by a resolute
reader, for the late Joseph Scott, Esq; founder of the trust
before-mentioned, assured me, in 1751, that he had perused Bailey's
Dictionary as methodically as he had done Tom Jones; and, though a
dissenter, he continued to read the Common Prayer Book from end to
end, about twice a year; which is more than, perhaps, the greatest
lover of that excellent composition can boast.</p>
<p>I shall, to avoid prolixity in a barren chapter of the two
extremes of life, select about every tenth year from the register.
Those years at the time of the plague, make no addition to the
burials, because the unhappy victims were conveyed to Lady-wood for
internment.</p>
<p>These lists inform us, that the number of streets, houses,
inhabitants, births, burials, poor's rates, and commercial
productions, increase with equal rapidity. It appears also from the
register, that there were more christenings lately at St. Martin's,
in one day, than the whole town produced in a year, in the 16th
century--The same may be found in that of St. Phillip's.</p>
<p>The deaths in Deritend are omitted, being involved with those of
Aston.</p>

<h2><a name="GENERAL_HOSPITAL."></a>GENERAL HOSPITAL.</h2>
<br>
<p>Though charity is one of the most amiable qualities of humanity,
yet, like Cupid, she ought to be represented blind; or, like
Justice, hood-winked. None of the virtues have been so much
misapplied; giving to the <i>hungry</i>, is sometimes only another
word for giving to the <i>idle</i>. We know of but two ways in
which this excellence can exert itself; improving the <i>mind</i>,
and nourishing the <i>body</i>. To help him who <i>will not</i>
help himself; or, indiscriminately to relieve those that want, is
totally to mistake the end; for want is often met with: but to
supply those who <i>cannot</i> supply themselves, becomes real
charity. Some worthy Christians have taken it into their heads to
relieve <i>all</i>, for fear of omitting the right. What should we
think of the constable who seizes every person he meets with, for
fear of missing the thief? Between the simple words, therefore, of
WILL NOT and CANNOT, runs the fine barrier between real and
mistaken charity.</p>
<p>This virtue, so strongly inculcated by the christian system,
hath, during the last seventeen centuries, appeared in a variety of
forms, and some of them have been detrimental to the interest they
were meant to serve: <i>Such was the cloister</i>. Man is not born
altogether to serve himself, but the community; if he cannot exist
without the assistance of others, it follows, that others ought to
be assisted by him: but if condemned to obscurity in the cell, he
is then fed by the aid of the public, while that public derives
none from him.</p>
<br>
<a name="image17.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/image17.jpg"><img src=
"images/image17.jpg" width="60%" alt=""></a><br>
<b><i>General Hospital</i>.</b></p>
<br>
<p>Estates have sometimes been devised in trust for particular
uses, meant as charities by the giver, but have, in a few years,
been diverted out of their original channel to other purposes.</p>
<p>The trust themselves, like so many contending princes, ardently
druggie for sovereignty; hence, <i>legacy</i> and <i>discord</i>
are intimate companions.</p>
<p>The plantation of many of our English schools sprang up from the
will of the dead; but it is observable, that sterility quickly
takes place; the establishment of the master being properly
secured, supineness enters, and the young scions of learning are
retarded in their growth.</p>
<p>It therefore admits a doubt, whether charitable donation is
beneficial to the world; nay, the estate itself becomes blasted
when bequeathed to public use, for, being the freehold of none,
none will improve it: besides, the more dead land, the less scope
for industry.</p>
<p>At the reformation, under Queen Elizabeth, charity seemed to
take a different appearance: employment was found for the idle; he
that was able, was obliged to labour, and the parish was obliged to
assist him who could not. Hence the kingdom became replete with
workhouses: these are the laudable repositories of distress.</p>
<p>It has already been observed, that three classes of people merit
the care of society: forlorn infancy, which is too weak for its own
support; old age, which has served the community, without serving
itself; and accidental calamity: the two first, fall under the eye
of the parish, the last, under the modern institution of the
General Hospital.</p>
<p>The shell of this plain, but noble edifice, was erected in 1766,
upon a situation very unsuitable for its elegant front, in a narrow
dirty lane, with an aspect directing up the hill, which should ever
be avoided.</p>
<p>The amiable desire of doing good in the inhabitants, seemed to
have exceeded their ability; and, to the grief of many, it lay
dormant for twelve years. In 1778, the matter was revived with
vigor; subscriptions filled apace, and by the next year the
hospital was finished, at the expence of 7137<i>l</i>. 10s. Though
the benefactions might not amount to this enormous sum, yet they
were noble, and truly characteristic of a generous people. The
annual subscriptions, as they stood at Michaelmas, 1779, were
901<i>l</i>. 19s. and, at Midsummer, 1780, 932<i>l</i>. 8s. During
these nine months, 529 patients were admitted, of which, 303 were
cured, 93 relieved, 112 remained on the books, only 5 died, and but
<i>one</i> was discharged as incurable; an incontestible proof of
the <i>skill</i> of the faculty, which is at least equalled by
their <i>humanity</i>, in giving their attendance gratis.</p>
<p>The rules by which this excellent charity is conducted, are
worthy of its authors: success hath fully answered expectation, and
the building will probably stand for ages, to tell posterity a
favourable tale of the present generation.</p>

<h2><a name="PUBLIC_ROADS."></a>PUBLIC ROADS.</h2>
<br>
<p>Man is evidently formed for society; the intercourse of one with
another, like two blocks of marble in friction, reduces the rough
prominences of behaviour, and gives a polish to the manners.</p>
<p>Whatever tends to promote social connection, improve commerce,
or stamp an additional value upon property, is worthy of
attention.</p>
<p>Perhaps, there is not a circumstance that points more favourably
towards these great designs, than commodious roads.</p>
<p>According as a country is improved in her roads, so will she
stand in the scale of civilization. It is a characteristic by which
we may pronounce with safety. The manners and the roads of the
English, have been refining together for about 1700 years. If any
period of time is distinguished with a more rapid improvement in
one, it is also in the other.</p>
<p>Our Saxons ancestors, of dusky memory, seldom stepped from under
the smoke of Birmingham. We have a common observation among us,
that even so late as William the Third, the roads were in so
dangerous a state, that a man usually made his will, and took a
formal fare-well of his friends, before he durst venture upon a
journey to London; which, perhaps, was thought then, of as much
consequence as a voyage to America now.</p>
<p>A dangerous road is unfavourable both to commerce and to
friendship; a man is unwilling to venture his neck to sell his
productions, or even visit his friend: if a dreadful road lies
between them, it will be apt to annihilate friendship.</p>
<p>Landed property in particular, improves with the road. If a
farmer cannot bring his produce to market, he cannot give much for
his land, neither can that land well be improved, or the market
properly supplied. Upon a well formed road, therefore, might, with
propriety, be placed the figures of commerce, of friendship, and of
agriculture, as presiding over it.</p>
<p>There are but very few observations necessary in forming a road,
and those few are very simple; to expel whatever is hurtful, and
invite whatever is beneficial.</p>
<p>The breaking up of a long frost, by loosening the foundations,
is injurious, and very heavy carriages ought to be prevented, 'till
the weather unites the disjointed particles, which will soon
happen.</p>
<p>But the grand enemy is water; and as this will inevitably fall,
every means should be used to discharge it: drains ought to be
frequent, that the water may not lie upon the road.</p>
<p>The great benefits are <i>the sun</i> and the <i>wind:</i> the
surveyor should use every method for the admission of these
friendly aids, that they may dispel the moisture which cannot run
off.</p>
<p>For this purpose, all public roads ought to be sixty feet wide;
all trees and hedges within thirty feet of the centre, be under the
controul of the commissioners, with full liberty of drawing off the
water in what manner they judge necessary.</p>
<p>The Romans were the most accomplished masters we know of in this
useful art; yet even they seem to have forgot the under drain, for
it is evident at this day, where their road runs along the
declivity of a hill, the water dams up, flows over, and injures the
road.</p>
<p>Care should be taken, in properly forming a road at first,
otherwise you may botch it for a whole century, and at the end of
that long period, it will be only a botch itself.</p>
<p>A wide road will put the innocent traveller out of fear of the
waggoners; not the most civilized of the human race.</p>
<p>From Birmingham, as from a grand centre, issues twelve roads,
that point to as many towns; some of these, within memory, have
scarcely been passable; all are mended, but though much is done,
more is wanted. In an upland country, like that about Birmingham,
where there is no river of size, and where the heads only of the
streams show themselves: the stranger would be surprised to hear,
that through most of these twelve roads he cannot travel in a flood
with safety. For want of causeways and bridges, the water is
suffered to flow over the road, higher than the stirrup: every
stream, though only the size of a tobacco-pipe, ought to be carried
through an under drain, never to run over the road.</p>
<p>At Saltley, in the way to Coleshill, which is ten miles, for
want of a causeway, with an arch or two, every flood annoys the
passenger and the road: at Coleshill-hall, 'till the year 1779, he
had to pass a dangerous river.</p>
<p>One mile from Birmingham, upon the Lichfield road, sixteen
miles, to the disgrace of the community, is yet a river without a
bridge. In 1777, the country was inclined to solicit Parliament for
a turnpike-act, but the matter fell to the ground through private
views: one would think, that the penny can never be ill laid out,
which carries a man ten miles with pleasure and safety. The hand of
nature hath been more beneficent, both to this, and to the Stafford
road, which is twenty-eight miles, than that of art.</p>
<p>The road to Walfall, ten miles, is rather <i>below
indifferent</i>.</p>
<p>That to Wolverhampton, thirteen miles, is much improved since
the coal-teams left it.</p>
<p>The road to Dudley, ten miles, is despicable beyond description.
The unwilling traveller is obliged to go two miles about, through a
bad road, to avoid a worse.</p>
<p>That to Hales-Owen, eight miles, like the life of man, is
checkered with good and evil; chiefly the latter.</p>
<p>To Bromsgrove, thirteen miles, made extremely commodious for the
first four, under the patronage of John Kettle, Esq; in 1772, at
the expence of near 5000<i>l</i>. but afterwards is so confined,
that two horses cannot pass without danger; the sun and the winds
are excluded, the rivers lie open to the stranger, and he travels
through dirt 'till Midsummer.</p>
<p>To Alcester, about twenty, formed in 1767, upon a tolerable
plan, but is rather too narrow, through a desolate country, which
at present scarcely defrays the expence; but that country seems to
improve with the road.</p>
<p>Those to Stratford and Warwick, about twenty miles each, are
much used and much neglected.</p>
<p>That to Coventry, about the same distance, can only be equalled
by the Dudley road. The genius of the age has forgot, in some of
these roads to accommodate the foot passenger with a causeway.</p>
<p>The surveyor will be inclined to ask, How can a capital be
raised to defray this enormous expence? Suffer me to reply with an
expression in the life of Oliver Cromwell, "He that lays out money
when necessary, and only then, will accomplish matters beyond the
reach of imagination."</p>
<p>Government long practised the impolitic mode of transporting
vast numbers of her people to America, under the character of
felons; these, who are generally in the prime of life, might be
made extremely useful to that country which they formerly robbed,
and against which, they are at this moment carrying arms. It would
be easy to reduce this ferocious race under a kind of martial
discipline; to badge them with a mark only removeable by the
governors, for hope should ever be left for repentance, and to
employ them in the rougher arts of life, according to the nature of
the crime, and the ability of body; such as working the coal mines
in Northumberland, the lead mines in Derbyshire, the tin mines in
Cornwall, cultivating waste lands, banking after inundations,
forming canals, cleansing the beds of rivers, assisting in harvest,
and in FORMING and MENDING the ROADS: <i>these hewers of wood and
drawers of water</i> would be a corps of reserve against any
emergency. From this magazine of villiany, the British navy might
be equipped with, considerable advantage.</p>

<h2><a name="CANAL."></a>CANAL.</h2>
<br>
<p>An act was obtained, in 1767, to open a cut between Birmingham
and the coal delphs about Wednesbury.</p>
<p>The necessary article of coal, before this act, was brought by
land, at about thirteen shillings per ton, but now at seven.</p>
<p>It was common to see a train of carriages for miles, to the
great destruction of the road, and the annoyance of travellers.</p>
<p>This dust is extended in the whole to about twenty-two miles in
length, 'till it unites with what we may justly term the grand
artery, or Staffordshire Canal; which, eroding the island,
communicates with Hull, Bristol and Liverpool. The expence was
about 70,000<i>l</i>. divided into shares 140<i>l</i>. each, of
which no man can purchase more than ten, and which now sell for
about 370<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>The proprietors took a perpetual lease of six acres of land, of
Sir Thomas Gooch, at 47<i>l</i>. per annum, which is converted into
a wharf, upon the front of which is erected an handsome office for
the dispatch of business.</p>

<br>
<p>This watery passage, exclusive of loading the proprietors with
wealth, tends greatly to the improvement of some branches of trade,
by introducing heavy materials at a small expence, such as pig iron
for the founderies, lime-stone, articles for the manufacture of
brass and steel, also stone, brick, slate, timber, &amp;c.</p>
<p>It is happy for the world, that public interest is grafted upon
private, and that both flourish together.</p>
<p>This grand work, like other productions of Birmingham birth, was
rather hasty; the managers, not being able to find patience to worm
round the hill at Smethwick, or cut through, have wisely travelled
over it by the help of twelve locks, with six they mount the
summit, and with six more descend to the former level; forgetting
the great waste of water, and the small supply from the rivulets,
and also, the amazing loss of of time in climbing this curious
ladder, consisting of twelve liquid steps. It is worthy of remark,
that the level of the earth, is nearly the same at Birmingham as at
the pits: what benefit then would accrue to commerce, could the
boats travel a dead flat of fourteen miles without interruption?
The use of the canal would increase, great variety of goods be
brought which are now excluded, and these delivered with more
expedition, with less expence, and the waste of water never felt;
but, by the introduction of twelve unnecessary locks, the company
may experience five plagues more than fell on Egypt.</p>
<p>The boats are nearly alike, constructed to fit the locks, carry
about twenty-five tons, and are each drawn by something like the
skeleton of a horse, covered with skin: whether he subsists upon
the scent of the water, is a doubt; but whether his life is a scene
of affliction, is not; for the unfeeling driver has no employment
but to whip him from one end of the canal to the other. While the
teams practised the turnpike road, the lash was divided among five
unfortunate animals, but now the whole wrath of the driver falls
upon one.</p>
<p>We can scarcely view a boat travelling this liquid road, without
raising opposite sensations--pleased to think of its great benefit
to the community, and grieved to behold wanton punishment.</p>
<p>I see a large field of cruelty expanding before me, which I
could easily prevail with myself to enter; in which we behold the
child plucking a wing and a leg off a fly, to try how the poor
insect can perform with half his limbs; or running a pin through
the posteriors of a locust, to observe it spinning through the air,
like a comet, drawing a tail of thread. If we allow, man has a
right to destroy noxious animals, we cannot allow he has a right to
protract their pain by a lingering death. By fine gradations the
modes of cruelty improve with years, in pinching the tail of a cat
for the music of her voice, kicking a dog because we have trod upon
his foot, or hanging him for <i>fun</i>, 'till we arrive at the
priests in the church of Rome, who burnt people for opinion; or to
the painter, who begged the life of a criminal, that he might
torture him to death with the severest pangs, to catch the
agonizing feature, and transfer it into his favourite piece, of a
dying Saviour. But did that Saviour teach such doctrine? Humanity
would wish rather to have lost the piece, than have heard of the
cruelty. What, if the injured ghost of the criminal is at this
moment torturing that of the painter?--</p>
<p>But as this capacious field is beyond the line I profess, and,
as I have no direct accusation against the people of my regard, I
shall not enter.</p>

<h2><a name="DERITEND_BRIDGE."></a>DERITEND BRIDGE.</h2>
<br>
<p>Cooper's-mill, situated upon the verge of the parishes of Afton
and Birmingham, 400 yards below this bridge, was probably first
erected in the the peaceable ages of Saxon influence, and continued
a part of the manorial estate 'till the disposal of it in 1730.</p>
<p>Before the water was pounded up to supply the mill, it must have
been so shallow, as to admit a passage between Digbeth and
Deritend, over a few stepping stones; and a gate seems to have been
placed upon the verge of the river, to prevent encroachments of the
cattle.</p>
<p>This accounts for the original name, which Dugdale tells us was
<i>Derry-yate-end:</i> derry, low; yate, gate; end, extremity of
the parish; with which it perfectly agrees.</p>
<p>The mill afterwards causing the water to be dammed up, gave rise
to a succession of paltry bridges, chiefly of timber, to preserve a
communication between the two streets.</p>
<p>But in later ages, the passage was dignified with those of
stone. In 1750, a wretched one was taken down, and the present
bridge erected by Henry Bradford and John Collins, overseers of the
highway, consisting of five arches; but the homely style, the deep
ascent, and the circumscribed width prevents encomium.</p>

<a name="SOHO"></a>
<h2>ADJACENT REMARKS.</h2>
<h3>SOHO.</h3>
<br>
<p>If we travel two miles from the centre of Birmingham, upon the
Wolverhampton road, which may be called, the road to taste, and is
daily travelled by the nobility and gentry, we shall arrive at the
epitome of the arts.</p>
<p>Though this little spot lies in the county of Stafford, we must
accept it as part of Birmingham; neither is it many yards distant
from the parish.</p>
<p>The proprietor, invited by a genius, a fortune of
30,000<i>l</i>. and a little stream, which promised to facilitate
business, has erected the most elegant works in these parts, said
to accommodate seven hundred persons. Upon that hungry ground,
where, in 1758 stood one paltry cottage, we now behold, a city in
miniature.</p>
<p>From this nursery of ingenuity, originated the Soho button, the
single wheel clock, the improvement of the steam engine, the
platina button, the method of taking exact copies of painting,
writing, &amp;c. also, the productions of fancy, in great variety;
with which some of the European princes are well acquainted.</p>
<p>To the genius of the place is owing the assay-office, for
marking standard wrought plate, which, prior to the year 1773, was
conveyed to London to receive the sanction of that office; but by
an act then obtained, the business is done here by an assay master,
superintended by four wardens: these are annually chosen out of
thirty-six guardians, whose chief duty consists in dining together,
at least once a year; for it appears from the chapter upon
government, that feasting makes a principal part of a Birmingham
office; and, however unwilling a man may seem to <i>enter in</i> we
generally find him pleased when he <i>is in</i>.</p>

<p>About five miles south of Birmingham, and five furlongs off
Solihull Lodge, is a place called <i>The Danes Camp</i>. But
although neither history nor tradition speak of this particular
event, it probably was raised in the ninth century.</p>
<p>The situation is well chosen, upon an eminence, about nine
acres, nearly triangular, is yet in tolerable perfection; the ditch
is about twenty feet wide; the base of the bank about the same;
admits but of one entrance, and is capable of being secured by
water. From the bottom of the ditch, to the top of the mound, was,
when made, about twenty feet; and is a production of great

<h2><a name="GENTLEMEN'S_SEATS."></a>GENTLEMEN'S SEATS.</h2>
<br>
<p>This neighbourhood may justly be deemed the seat of the arts,
but not the seat of the gentry.</p>
<p>None of the nobility are near us, except William Legge, Earl of
Dartmouth, at Sandwell, four miles from Birmingham. The principal
houses in our environs, are those of Sir Charles Holte, late member
for the county, at Aston; Sir Henry Gough, member for Bamber, at
Edgbaston; George Birch, Esq; at Handsworth; John Gough, Esq; at
Perry; and John Taylor, Esq; at Bordesley and at Moseley; all
joining to the manor of Birmingham. Exclusive of these, are many
elegant retreats of our first inhabitants, acquired by commercial
success.</p>
<p>Full fed with vanity is an author, when two readers strive to
catch up his work, for the pleasure of perusing it:--but,
perchance, if two readers dip into this chapter, they may strive to
lay it down.</p>
<p>I have hitherto written to the <i>world</i>, but now to a small
part, <i>the antiquarians</i>; nay, a small part of the sensible
part; for a fool and an antiquary is a contradiction: they are, to
a man, people of letters and penetration. If their judgment is
sometimes erroneous, we may consider, man was never designed for
perfection; there is also less light to guide them in this, than in
other researches. If the traveller slips upon common ground, how
will he fare if he treads upon ice?--Besides, in dark questions, as
in intricate journies, there are many erroneous ways for one
right.</p>
<p>If, like the mathematician, he can establish one point, it
ascertains another. We may deem his pursuit one of the most
arduous, and attended with the least profit: his emoluments consist
in the returns of pleasure to his own mind.</p>
<p>The historian only collects the matter of the day, and hands it
to posterity; but the antiquarian brings his treasures from remote
ages, and presents them to this: he examines forgotten
repositories, calls things back into existence, which are past;
counter-acts the efforts of time, and of death; possesses something
like a re-creative power; collects the dust of departed matter,
moulds it into its prestine state, exhibits the figure to view, and
stamps it with a kind of immortality.</p>
<p>Every thing has its day, whether it be a nation, a city, a
castle, a man, or an insect; the difference is, one is a winter's
day, the other may be extended to the length of a summer's--an
<i>end</i> waits upon all. But we cannot contemplate the end of
grandeur, without gloomy ideas.</p>
<p>Birmingham is surrounded with the melancholy remains of
extinguished greatness; the decayed habitations of decayed gentry,
fill the mind with sorrowful reflections. Here the feet of those
marked the ground, whose actions marked the page of history. Their
arms glistened in the field; their eloquence moved the senate. Born
to command, their influence was extensive; but who now rest in
peace among the paupers, fed with the crumbs of their table. The
very land which, for ages, was witness to the hospitality of its
master, is itself doomed to stirility. The spot which drew the
adjacent country, is neglected by all; is often in a wretched state
of cultivation, sets for a trifle; the glory is departed; it
demands a tear from the traveller, and the winds teem, to sigh over
it.</p>

of the Fields; which, though a family of opulence, were so far from
being lords of the manor, that they were in vassalage to them.</p>
<p>The whole of that extensive parish is in the crown, which holds
the detestable badge of ancient slavery over every tenant, of
demanding under the name of harriot, the best moveable he dies
possessed of--Thus death and the bailiff make their inroads
together; they rob the family in a double capacity, each taking the
best moveable.</p>
<p>As the human body descends into the regions of sickness, much
sooner than it can return into health; so a family can decline into
poverty by hastier steps, than rise into affluence. One generation
of extravagance puts a period to many of greatness.</p>
<p>A branch of the Fields, in 1777, finished their ancient

<br>
<p>Four miles from Birmingham, upon the Warwick road, entering the
parish of Solihull, in Castle-lane, is Ulverle, in doom's-day
Ulverlei. Trifling as this place now seems, it must have been the
manor-house of Solihull, under the Saxon heptarchy; but went to
decay so long ago as the conquest.</p>
<p>The manor was the property of the Earls of Mercia, but whether
their residence is uncertain.--The traces of a moat yet remain,
which are triangular, and encircle a wretched farm-house of no
note: one of the angles of this moat is filled up, and become part
of Castle-lane; which proves that Ulverley went into disuse when
Hogg's-moat was erected: it also proves that the lane terminated
here, which is about two hundred yards from the turnpike road. The
great width of the lane, from the road to Ulverley, and the
singular narrowness from thence to Hogg's-moat, is another proof of
its prior antiquity.</p>

<h2><a name="HOGG'S-MOAT."></a>HOGG'S-MOAT.</h2>
<br>
<p>At Oltenend (Old Town) originally Odingsell's-moat, now
Hobb's-moat, the ancient manor-house of Solihull, after it had
changed its lords at the conquest. The property, as before
observed, of Edwin Earl of Mercia, in the reign of Edward the the
Confessor.</p>
<p>William the First granted the manor to a favourite lady, named
Cristina, probably a handsome lass, of the same complexion as his
mother; thus we err when we say William gave all the land in the
kingdom to his followers--some little was given to those <i>he</i>
followed.</p>
<p>This lady, like many of her successors, having tired the arms of
royalty, was conveyed into those of an humble favourite; Ralph de
Limesie married her, who became lord of the place, but despising
Ulverley, erected this castle.</p>
<p>The line of Limesie continued proprietors four descents; when,
in the reign of King John, it became the property of Hugh de
Odingsells, by marrying a co-heiress.</p>
<p>The last of the Odingsells, in 1294, left four daughters, one of
whom, with the lordship, fell into the hands of John de Clinton;
but it is probable the castle was not inhabited after the above
date, therefore would quickly fall to decay.</p>
<p>The moat is upon a much larger plan than Ulverley, takes in a
compass of five acres, had two trenches; the outer is nearly
obliterated, but the inner is marked with the strongest lines we
meet with. This trench is about twenty feet deep, and about thirty
yards from the crown of one bank to the other.</p>
<p>When Dugdale saw it, about a hundred and fifty years ago, the
center, which is about two acres, where the castle stood, was
covered with old oaks; round this center are now some thousands,
the oldest of which is not more than a century; so that the timber
is changed since the days of Dugdale, but not the appearance of the
land.</p>
<p>The center is bare of timber, and exhibits the marks of the
plough. The late Benjamin Palmer, Esq; a few years ago, planted it
with trees, which are in that dwindling state, that they are not
likely to grow so tall as their master<a name=
"FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7">[7]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor7">[7]</a>
He measured about six feet five inches, but was singularly short in
the lower parts: his step was not larger than a child's of ten
years old. His carriage, by its extraordinary height, looked at a
distance like a moving steeple; he sat as high in a common chair,
as a man of the middle-size stands: he was as immoderately heavy as
he was tall, and as remarkable for good-nature as either. As a man,
he shone by his bulk; as a magistrate, in a dull but honest
light--his decisions were <i>intended</i> to be just. He seemingly
dozed as he walked; but if his own eyes were half shut, those of
every other person were open to see him.</blockquote>
<p>It lies in a pleasant situation, upon a descent, so that the
trench in one part is dry, and in another three or four yards deep
in water.</p>
<p>A place of such desolation, one would think, was a place of
silence--just the reverse. When I saw it, Feb. 23, 1783, the trees
were tall, the winds high, and the roar tremendous.</p>
<p>Exclusive of Ulverley and Hogg's-moat, there are many old
foundations in Solihull, once the residence of gentry now extinct;
as Solihull-hall, the Moat-house, and Kynton, the property of the
Botolers; Bury-hall, that of the Warings; who both came over with
William: Henwood, belonging to the Hugfords; Hillfield-hall, the

the land springs; is filled up in the front of the hall, as there
is not much need of water protection. The house, which gives an
idea of former gentility, seems the first erected on the spot; is
irregular, agreeable to the taste of the times, and must have been
built many centuries. All the ancient furniture fled with its
owners, except an hatchment in the hall, with sixteen coats of
arms, specifying the families into which they married.</p>

<h2><a name="KING'S-HURST."></a>KING'S-HURST.</h2>
<br>
<p>Two furlongs east of Sheldon-hall, and one mile south of Castle
Bromwich, is <i>Kings-hurst</i>; which, though now a dwelling in
tenancy, was once the capital of a large track of land, consisting
of its own manor, Coleshill, and Sheldon; the demesne of the crown,
under the Saxon kings, from whom we trace the name.</p>
<p>The Conqueror, or his son William, granted it; but whether for
money, service, caprice, or favour, is uncertain; for he who wears
a crown acts as whimsically as he who does not.</p>
<p>Mountfort came over with William, as a knight, and an officer of
rank; but, perhaps, did not immediately receive the grant, for the
king would act again much like other people, <i>give away their
property, before he would give away his own</i>.</p>
<p>If this unfortunate family were not the first grantees, they
were lords, and probably residents of King's-hurst, long before
their possession of Coleshill, in 1332, and by a younger branch,
long after the unhappy attainder of Sir Simon, in 1497.</p>
<p>Sir William Mountfort, in 1390, augmented the buildings, erected
a chapel, and inclosed the manor. His grandson, Sir Edmund, in
1447, paled in some of the land, and dignified it with the
fashionable name of <i>park</i>.</p>
<p>This prevailing humour of imparking was unknown to the Saxons,
it crept in with the Norman: some of the first we meet with are
those of Nottingham, Wedgnock, and Woodstock--Nottingham, by
William Peveral, illegitimate son of the Conqueror; Wedgnock, by
Newburg, the first Norman Earl of Warwick; and Woodstock, by Henry
the First. So that the Duke of Marlborough perhaps may congratulate
himself with possessing the oldest park in use.</p>
<p>The modern park is worth attention; some are delightful in the
extreme: they are the beauties of creation, terrestrial paradises;
they are just what they ought to be, nature cautiously assisted by
invisible art. We envy the little being who presides over one--but
why mould we envy him? the pleasure consists in <i>seeing</i>, and
one man may <i>see</i> as well as another: nay, the stranger holds
a privilege beyond him; for the proprietor, by often seeing, sees
away the beauties, while he who looks but seldom, sees with full
effect. Besides, one is liable to be fretted by the mischievous
hand of injury, which the stranger seldom sees; he looks for
excellence, the owner for defect, and they both find.</p>
<p>These proud inclosures, guarded by the growth within, first
appeared under the dimension of one or two hundred acres; but
fashion, emulation, and the park, grew up together, till the last
swelled into one or two thousand.</p>
<p>If religions rise from the lowest ranks, the fashions generally
descend from the higher, who are at once blamed, and imitated by
their inferiors.</p>
<p>The highest orders of men lead up a fashion, the next class
tread upon their heels, the third quickly follow, then the fourth,
fifth, &amp;c. immediately figure after them. But as a man who had
an inclination for a park, could not always spare a thousand acres,
he must submit to less, for a park must be had: thus Bond, of
Ward-end, set up with thirty; some with one half, till the very
word became a burlesque upon the idea. The design was a display of
lawns, hills, water, clumps, &amp;c. as if ordered by the voice of
nature; and furnished with herds of deer. But some of our modern
parks contain none of these beauties, nor scarcely land enough to
support a rabbit.</p>
<p>I am possessed of one of these jokes of a park, something less
than an acre:--he that has none, might think it a <i>good</i> joke,
and wish it his own; he that has more would despise it: that it
never was larger, appears from its being surrounded by Sutton
Coldfield; and that it has retained the name for ages, appears from
the old timber upon it.</p>
<p>The manor of King's-hurst was disposed of by the Mountforts,
about two hundred years ago, to the Digbys, where it remains.</p>

<h2><a name="COLESHILL."></a>COLESHILL.</h2>
<br>
<p>One mile farther east is <i>Coleshill-hall</i>, vested in the
crown before, and after the conquest; purchased, perhaps, of
William Rufus, by Geoffrey de Clinton, ancestor to the present Duke
of Newcastle. In 1352, an heiress of the house of Clinton, gave it,
with herself, to Sir John de Mountfort, of the same family with
Simon, the great Earl of Leicester, who fell, in 1265, at Evesham,
in that remarkable contest with Henry the Third.</p>
<p>With them it continued till 1497, when Sir Simon Mountfort,
charged, but perhaps unjustly, with assisting Perkin Warbeck with
30<i>l</i>. was brought to trial at Guildhall, condemned as a
traitor, executed at Tyburn, his large fortune confiscated, and his
family ruined. Some of his descendants I well know in Birmingham;
and <i>they</i> are well known to poverty, and the vice.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry the Seventh, it was almost dangerous,
particularly for a rich man, even to <i>think</i> against a crafty
and avaricious monarch.--What is singular, the man who accused Sir
Simon at the bar, succeeded him in his estate.</p>
<p>Simon Digby procured a grant of the place, in whose line it
still continues. The hall is inhabited, but has been left about
thirty years by the family; was probably erected by the Mountforts,
is extensive, and its antique aspect without, gives a venerable
pleasure to the beholder, like the half admitted light diffused
within. Every spot of the park is delightful, except that in which
the hall stands: our ancestors built in the vallies, for the sake
of water; their successors on the hills, for the sake of air.</p>
<p>From this uncouth swamp sprung the philosopher, the statesman,
and tradition says, the gunpowder-plot.</p>

<h2><a name="DUDDESTON."></a>DUDDESTON.</h2>
<br>
<p>Four furlongs north-east of Birmingham, is <i>Duddeston</i>
(Dud's-town) from Dud, the Saxon proprietor, Lord of Dudley, who
probably had a seat here; once a considerable village, but long
reduced to the manor-house, till Birmingham, swelling beyond its
bounds, in 1764, verged upon this lordship; and we now, in 1783,
behold about eighty houses, under the names of Duke-street,
Prospect-row, and Woodcock-lane.</p>
<p>It afterwards descended to the Paganalls, the Sumeris, then to
the Bottetourts, and was, in 1323, enjoyed by Joan Bottetourt, lady
of Weoley castle, a daughter of the house of Sumeri.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas de Erdington held it of this lady, by a chief-rent,
which was a pair of gilt spurs, or six-pence, at the option of the
tenant.</p>
<p>Erdington sold it, in 1327, to Thomas de Maidenhache, by whose
daughter, Sibell, it came in marriage to Adam de Grymforwe; whose
posterity, in 1363, conveyed it for 26<i>l</i>. 13s. 4d. now worth
20,000<i>l</i>. to John atte Holt; and his successors made it their
residence, till the erection of Aston-hall, in the reign of James
I.</p>
<p>It is now converted into beautiful gardens, as a public resort
of pleasure, and dignified with the London name of Vauxhall. The
demolished fish-ponds, and the old foundations, which repel the
spade, declare its former grandeur.</p>
<p>In 1782 it quitted, by one of the most unaccountable alignments
that ever resulted from human weakness, the ancient name of Holte,
familiar during four hundred and nineteen years, for that of
Legge.</p>
<p>Could the ghost of Sir Lister re-visit his departed property,
one might ask, What reception might you meet with, Sir Lister, in
1770, among your venerable ancestors in the shades, for barring,
unprovoked, an infant heiress of 7000<i>l</i>. a year, and giving
it, unsolicited, to a stranger? Perhaps you experience repeated
buffetings; a sturdy figure, with iron aspect, would be apt to
accost you--"I with nervous arm, and many a bended back, drew
40<i>l</i>. from the Birmingham forge, with which, in 1330, I
purchased the park and manor of Nechels, now worth four hundred
times that sum. I planted that family which you have plucked up by
the roots: in the sweat of my brow, I laid a foundation for
greatness; many of my successors built on that foundation--but you,
by starving your brother, Sir Charles, into compliance, wantonly
cut off the entail, and gave away the estate, after passing through
seventeen descents, merely to shew you had a power to give it. We
concluded here, that a son of his daughter, the last hope of the
family, would change his own name to preserve ours, and not the
estate change its possessor."--"I," another would be apt to say,
"with frugal hand, and lucrative employments under the crown,
added, in 1363, the manor of Duddeston; and, in 1367, that of
Alton. But for what purpose did I add them? To display the folly of
a successor."--A dejected spectre would seem to step forward, whose
face carried the wrinkles of eighty-four, and the shadow of tear;
"I, in 1611, brought the title of baronet among us, first tarnished
by you; which, if your own imbecility could not procure issue to
support, you ought to have supported it by purchase. I also, in
1620, erected the mansion at Afton, then, and even now, the most
superb in that neighbourhood, fit to grace the leading title of
nobility; but you forbad my successors to enter. I joined, in 1647,
to our vast fortune, the manor of Erdington.--Thus the fabric we
have been rearing for ages, you overthrew in one fatal
moment."--The last angry spectre would appear in the bloom of life.
"I left you an estate which you did not deserve: you had no more
right to leave it from your successor, than I to leave it from you:
one man may ruin the family of another, but he seldom ruins his
own. We blame him who wrongs his neighbour, but what does he
deserve who wrongs himself?--You have done both, for by cutting off
the succession, your name will be lost. The ungenerous attorney,
instead of making your absurd will, ought to have apprized you of
our sentiments, which exactly coincide with those of the world, or
how could the tale affect a stranger? Why did not some generous
friend guide your crazy vessel, and save a sinking family?
Degenerate son, he who destroys the peace of another, should
forfeit his own--we leave you to remorse, may she quickly <i>find,
and weep over you</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="SALTLEY."></a>SALTLEY.</h2>
<br>
<p>A mile east of Duddeston is <i>Saltley-hall</i>, which, with an
extensive track of ground, was, in the Saxon times, the freehold of
a person whom we should now call Allen; the same who was Lord of
Birmingham. But at the conquest, when justice was laid asleep, and
property possessed by him who could seize it, this manor, with many
others, fell into the hands of William Fitz-Ausculf, Baron of
Dudley-castle, who granted it in knight's-service to Henry de
Rokeby.</p>
<p>A daughter of Rokeby carried it by marriage to Sir John Goband,
whose descendants, in 1332, sold it to Walter de Clodshale; an
heiress of Clodshale, in 1426, brought it into the ancient family
of Arden, and a daughter of this house, to that of Adderley, where
it now rests.</p>
<p>The castle, I have reason to think, was erected by Rokeby, in
which all the lords resided till the extinction of the
Clodshales.--It has been gone to ruin about three hundred years,
and the solitary platform seems to mourn its loss.</p>

<h2><a name="WARD-END."></a>WARD-END.</h2>
<br>
<p>Three miles from Birmingham, in the same direction, is
<i>Wart-end</i>, anciently <i>Little Bromwich</i>; a name derived
from the plenty of broom, and is retained to this day by part of
the precincts, <i>Broomford</i> (Bromford).</p>
<p>This manor was claimed by that favourite of the conqueror,
Fitz-Ausculf, and granted by him to a second-hand favourite, who
took its name.</p>
<p>The old castle has been gone about a century; the works are
nearly complete, cover about nine acres, the most capacious in this
neighbourhood, those of Weoley-castle excepted. The central area is
now an orchard, and the water, which guarded the castle, guards the
fruit. This is surrounded with three mounds, and three trenches,
one of them fifty yards over, which, having lost its master, guards
the fish.</p>
<p>The place afterwards passed through several families, till the
reign of Henry the Seventh. One of them bearing the name of
<i>Ward</i>, changed the name to <i>Ward-end</i>.</p>
<p>In 1512, it was the property of John Bond, who, fond of his
little hamlet, inclosed a park of thirty acres, stocked it with
deer; and, in 1517, erected a chapel for the conveniency of his
tenants, being two miles from the parish church of Afton. The
skeleton of this chapel, in the form of a cross, the fashion of the
times, is yet standing on the outward mound: its floor is the only
religious one I have seen laid with horse-dung; the pulpit is
converted into a manger--it formerly furnished husks for the man,
but now corn for the horse. Like the first christian church, it has
experienced a double use, a church and a stable; but with this
difference, <i>that</i> in Bethlehem, was a stable advanced into a
church; this, on the contrary, is reduced into a stable.</p>
<p>The manor, by a female, passed through the Kinardsleys, and is
now possessed by the Brand-woods; but the hall, erected in 1710,
and its environs, are the property of Abraham Spooner, Esq.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="CASTLE_BROMWICH."></a>CASTLE BROMWICH.</h2>
<br>
<p>Simply <i>Bromwich</i>, because the soil is productive of
broom.</p>
<p>My subject often leads me back to the conquest, an enterprize,
wild without parallel: we are astonished at the undertaking,
because William was certainly a man of sense, and a politician.
Harold, his competitor, was a prince much superior in power, a
consummate general, and beloved by his people. The odds were so
much against the invader, that out of one hundred such imprudent
attempts, ninety-nine would miscarry: all the excuse in his favour
is, <i>it succeeded</i>. Many causes concurred in this success,
such as his own ambition, aided by his valour; the desperate
fortune of his followers, very few of whom were men of property,
for to the appearance of gentlemen, they added the realities of
want; a situation to which any change is thought preferable; but,
above all, <i>chance</i>. A man may dispute for religion, he may
contend for liberty, he may run for his life, but he will
<i>fight</i> for property.</p>
<p>By the contest between William and Harold, the unhappy English
lost all they had to lose; and though this all centered in the
Normans, they did not acquire sufficient to content them.</p>
<p>History does not inform us who was then the proprietor of Castle
Bromwich, but that it belonged to the Mercian Earls scarcely admits
a doubt; as Edwin owned some adjoining manors, he probably owned
this. Fitz-Ausculf was his fortunate successor, who procured many
lordships in the neighhood of Birmingham; Castle Bromwich was one.
He granted it to an inferior Norman, in military tenure; who,
agreeable to the fashion of those times, took the surname of
Bromwich.</p>
<p>Henry de Castel was a subsequent proprietor. Dugdale supposes
the village took its name from a castle, once on the premises; and
that the castle-hill yet remains: but this hill is too small, even
to admit a shelter for a Lilliputian, and is evidently an
artificial trifle, designed for a monument. It might hold, for its
ancient furniture, a turret, termed a castle--perhaps it held
nothing in Dugdale's time: the modern is a gladiator, in the
attitude of fighting, supported by a pedestal, containing the
Bridgeman arms.</p>
<p><i>Castle</i>, probably, was added by the family of that name,
lords of the place, to distinguish it from <i>woody</i> and
<i>little</i> Bromwich. They bore for their arms, three castles and
a chevron.</p>
<p>Lord Ferrers of Chartley, who was proprietor of Birmingham in
the reign of Henry the Sixth, enjoyed it by marriage; and his grand
daughter brought it, by the same channel, into the family of
Devereux, Lords of Sheldon. Edward, about the latter end of Queen
Elizabeth's reign, erected the present building, which is
capacious, is in a stile between ancient and modern, and has a
pleasing appearance.</p>
<p>The Bridgeman family acceded to possession about eighty years
ago, by purchase, and made it their residence till about 1768. We
should naturally enquire, Why Sir Harry quitted a place so
delightfully situated? Perhaps it is not excelled in this country,
in the junction of three great roads, a a desirable neighbourhood,
the river Tame at its back, and within five miles of the plentiful
market of Bimingham--but, alas, <i>it has no park</i>.</p>
<p>The gentry seem to have resided in our vicinity, when there was
the greatest inducement to leave it, <i>impassable roads</i>: they
seem also to have quitted the country, now there is the greatest
inducement to reside there; roads, which improve their estates, and
may be travelled with pleasure. It may be objected, that "the
buildings become ancient." But there is no more disgrace in an old
house, than in an old man; they may both be dressed in character,
and look well. A gentleman, by residing in the family seat, pays a
compliment to his ancestors.</p>

<br>
<p>Six miles north-east of Birmingham, and one from Castle Bromwich
chapel, is a spacious moat, with one trench, which, for many
centuries guarded <i>Park-hall</i>. This is another of those
desolate islands, from which every creature is fled, and every
sound, except that of the winds; nay, even the very clouds seem to
lament the desolation with tears.</p>
<p>This was possessed by none but the Ardens, being part of their
vast estate long before the conquest, and five hundred years after.
A delightful situation on the banks of the Tame; to which we are
led through a dirty road.</p>
<p>We may consider this island, the treasury into which forty-six
lordships paid their tribute. The riches of the country were drawn
to this center, and commands were issued from it. The growth of
these manors supplied that spot, which now grows for another. The
lordships are in forty-six hands; the country is in silence; the
island ploughed up, and the family distressed--At the remembrance
of their name, the smile quits the face of history; she records
their sad tale with a sigh; while their arms are yet displayed in
some of the old halls in the neighbourhood.</p>

<br>
<p>Crossing the river, one mile farther east, is

guards--nothing. This, with the manor to which it belongs, was also
the property of the Ardens; one of which in the reign of Henry the
Second, granted it to the canons of Leicester; who added a chapel,
which went to decay four hundred years ago. After the grant, the
Ardens seem to have become tenants to the canons for the land, once
their own: we frequently observe a man pay rent for what he
<i>sells</i>, but seldom for what he <i>gives</i>.</p>
<p>At the dissolution of abbies, in 1537, Thomas Arden, the head of
the family, purchased it of Henry the Eighth, for 272<i>l</i>. 10s.
uniting it again to his estate, after a separation of three hundred
and fifty years, in whose posterity it continued till their
fall.</p>
<p>Thus, the father first purchased what the son gave away, and his
offspring re-purchased again. The father lays a tax on his
successor; or, climbs to heaven at the expence of the son. In one
age it is meritorious to <i>give</i> to the church, in another, to
<i>take</i> from her.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="ERDINGTON."></a>ERDINGTON.</h2>
<br>
<p>Three miles north-east of Birmingham, is <i>Erdington-hall</i>,
which boasts a long antiquity. The manor was the property of the
old Earls of Mercia: Edwin possessed it at the conquest, but lost
it in favour of William Fitz-Ausculf, who no doubt granted it in
knight's service to his friend and relation, of Norman race, who
erected the hall; the moat, took his residence in, and his name
Erdington, from the place. His descendants seem to have resided
here with great opulence near 400 years.</p>
<p>Dugdale mentions a circumstance of Sir Thomas de Erdington,
little noticed by our historians. He was a faithful adherent to
King John, who conferred on him many valuable favours: harrassed by
the Pope on one side, and his angry Barons on the other, he
privately sent Sir Thomas to Murmeli, the powerful King of Africa,
Morocco, and Spain; with offers to forsake the christian faith,
turn mahometan, deliver up his kingdom, and hold it of him in
tribute, for his assistance against his enemies. But it does not
appear the ambassador succeeded: the Moorish Monarch did not chuse
to unite his prosperous fortune with that of a random prince; he
might also consider, the man who could destroy his nephew and his
sovereign, could not be an honour to any profession.</p>
<p>The manor left the Erdington family in 1472, and, during a
course of 175 years, acknowledged for its owners, George
Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, Sir William Harcourt, Robert Wright,
Sir Reginald Bray, Francis Englefield, Humphry Dimock, Walter Earl,
Sir Walter Devereux, and was, in 1647, purchased by Sir Thomas
Holte, in whose family it continued till 1782, when Henage Legge,
Esq; became seised of the manor.</p>
<p>As none of the Lords seem to have resided upon the premises
since the departure of the Erdingtons, it must be expected they
have gradually tended to decay.</p>
<p>We may with some reason conclude, that as Erdington was the
freehold of the Earls of Mercia, it was not the residence of its
owners, therefore could not derive its name from them. That as the
word <i>Arden</i> signifies a wood, the etymology of that populous
village is, <i>a town in the wood</i>. That one of the first
proprietors, after the conquest, struck with the security offered
by the river, erected the present fortifications, which cover three
parts of the hall, and the river itself the fourth. Hence it
follows, that the neighbouring work, which we now call
Bromford-forge, was a mill prior to the conquest; because the
stream is evidently turned out of its bed to feed it. That the
present hall is the second on the premises, and was erected by the
Erdingtons, with some later additions.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="PIPE."></a>PIPE.</h2>
<br>
<p>One mile north-east of Erdington, is <i>Pipe-hall</i>; which,
with its manor, like the neighbouring land, became at the conquest
the property of Fitz-Ausculf; and afterwards of his defendants,
Paganall, Sumeri, Bottetort, and St. Leger.</p>
<p>It was common at that fatal period, for one of these great
barons, or rather great robbers, to procure a large quantity of
land for himself; some of them two or three hundred thousand
acres--too much for one man to grasp. He therefore kept what he
pleased for his private use, and granted the other in
knight's-service, reserving annually a rent. These rents were
generally small, so as never to hurt the tenant: however, the lord
could order him to arms whenever he pleased.</p>
<p>A few of the grants were procured by the disinherited English,
but chiefly by the officers of William's army, being more
respected, and more proper to be trusted: they were often
relations, or favourites of the great barons. The lord could not
conveniently sell, without the consent of the crown, but he could
set at what price he pleased. Time made this chief-rent permanent,
and gave the tenant stability of title.</p>
<p>The manor of Pipe, with some others, was granted to William
Mansell, who resided in the hall, and executed some of the chief
offices of the county.</p>
<p>The last of the name, in the reign of Henry the Third, left a
daughter, who married Henry de Harcourt; and his daughter married
John de Pipe, who seems to have taken its name.</p>
<p>Henry, his descendant, had many children, all of whom, with his
lady, died of the plague, except a daughter, Margery. He afterwards
married, in 1363, Matilda, the daughter of George de Castell, of
Castle Bromwich; but soon after the happy wedding, he perceived his
bride was pregnant, which proved, on enquiry, the effect of an
intrigue with her father's menial servant; a striking instance of
female treachery, which can only be equalled by--male.</p>
<p>The shock proving too great for his constitution, brought on a
decline, and himself to the grave, before the birth of the
child.</p>
<p>John was the fruit of this unlawful amour, whose guardian, to
prevent his inheriting the estate, made him a canon of Ouston, in
Leicestershire; and afterwards persuaded the unhappy Margery to
grant the manor to the abbot of Stonely.</p>
<p>Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, afterwards purchased it
for 133<i>l</i>. 6s. 8d. It came to the crown by attainder, in the
reign of Henry the Seventh; then to Sir William Staunford, one of
his judges, John Buttler; Edward Holte, in 1568; Francis Dimock,
whose daughter married Walter Earl; then to Walter Devereux, by
marrying Earl's daughter; afterwards to Sir Thomas Holte, by
purchase; and is now in the family of Bagot.</p>
<p>Though the hall is antique, its front is covered in the modern
barbarous stile, by a clump of venerable trees; which would become
any situation but that in which they stand. It is now inhabited by
a gentleman of Birmingham, who has experienced the smiles of
commerce.</p>

<br>
<p>Two miles north of Birmingham, is Aston (East-town) being east
of Westbury (Wednesbury) it lies on a steep descent towards the
river Tame.</p>
<p>This place, like that of Erdington, belonged to the Earls of
Mercia in the Saxon times; and, at the conquest, was the property
of the unfortunate Edwin. Fitz-Ausculf became his successor in
this, and in other lands: the survey calls it eight hides, valued
at 5<i>l</i>. per annum; a mill, 3s. and a wood, three miles long,
and half a mile broad. The mill, I make no doubt, stood where a
mill now stands, near Sawford-bridge; but neither the hides, nor
the wood, could be confined within the boundary of Afton; the manor
is too little for either. The lordship extends about a square mile,
and that part which is now the park, I have reason to think, was
then a common, and for ages after.</p>
<p>A Saxon, of the name of Godmund, held it under the Mercian
Earls, and found means, at the conquest, to hold it under the
Norman.</p>
<p>One hundred yards north of the church, in a perfect swamp, stood
the hall; probably erected by Godmund, or his family: the situation
shews the extreme of bad taste--one would think, he endeavoured to
lay his house under the water. The trenches are obliterated by the
floods, so as to render the place unobserved by the stranger: it is
difficult to chuse a worse, except he had put his house under the
earth. I believe there never was more than one house erected on the
spot, and that was one too much.</p>
<p>Whether this Saxon family of Godmund became extinct, or had lost
their right, is uncertain; but Sumeri, Fitz-Ausculf's successor,
about 1203, granted the manor to Sir Thomas de Erdington,
Ambassador to King John, mentioned before, who had married his
sister; paying annually a pair of spurs, or six-pence, as a nominal
rent, but meant, in reality, as a portion for the lady.</p>
<p>The family of Erdington, about 1275, sold it to Thomas de
Maidenhache, who did not seem to live upon friendly terms with his
neighbour, William de Birmingham; for, in 1290, he brought an
action against him for fishing in his water, called Moysich
(Dead-branch) leading into Tame, towards Scarford-bridge
(Shareford, dividing the shares, or parts of the parish, Aston
manor from Erdington, now Sawford-bridge) which implies a degree of
unkindness; because William could not amuse himself in his own
manor of Birmingham, for he might as well have angled in one of his
streets, as in the river Rea. The two lords had, probably, four
years before been on friendly terms, when they jointly lent their
assistance to the hospital of St. Thomas, in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Maidenhache left four daughters; Sibel, married Adam de
Grymsorwe, who took with her the manor of Aston; a daughter of this
house, in 1367, sold it to John atte Holte, of Birmingham, in whose
family it continued 415 years, till 1782, when Henage Legge, Esq;
acceded to possession.</p>
<p>This wretched bog was the habitation of all the lords, from
Godmund to the Holtes, the Erdington's excepted; for Maud Grymsorwe
executing the conveyance at Aston, indicates that she resided
there; and Thomas Holte, being possessed of Duddeston, proves that
he did not: therefore I conclude, that the building, as it ought,
went to decay soon after; so that desolation has claimed the place
for her own near four hundred years. This is corroberated by some
old timber trees, long since upon the spot where the building
stood.</p>
<p>The extensive parish of Aston takes in the two extremes of
Birmingham, which supplies her with more christenings, weddings,
and burials, than were, a few years ago, supplied by the whole
parish of Birmingham.</p>

<h2><a name="WITTON."></a>WITTON.</h2>
<br>
<p>Three miles north of Birmingham, and one from Aston, is
<i>Witton</i>, (Wicton) from the bend of the river, according to
Dugdale: the property of a person at the conquest whose name was
Staunchel. Fitz-Ausculf seized it, and Staunchel, more fortunate
than the chief of his country men, became his tenant; valued in the
conqueror's survey at 20s. per ann.</p>
<p>It was afterwards vested in the crown: in 1240, Henry the third
granted it to Andrew de Wicton, who took his name from the place,
for in Dooms-day it is Witone; therefore the name being prior,
proves the remark.</p>
<p>Andrew, anxious after the boundary of his new purchase, brought
an action against his neighbour, William de Pyrie (Perry) for
infringing his property. Great disputes arise from small
beginnings; perhaps a lawyer blew the flame.</p>
<p>The king issued his precept to the Sheriff of Staffordshire, in
which Perry lies, to bring with him twelve lawful and discreet
knights; and the same to the Sheriff of Warwickshire, of which
Witton is part, to ascertain the bounds between them.</p>
<p>Which was the aggressor, is hard to determine, but I should
rather suppose Squire Perry, because <i>man</i> is ever apt to
trespass; he resided on the premises, and the crown is but a sleepy
landlord; not so likely to rob, as be robbed.</p>
<p>There is a road, where foot seldom treads, mounded on each side,
leading over the Coldfield, from Perry-bridge towards the Newlands,
undoubtedly the work of this venerable band of discreet
knights.</p>
<p>The stranger, of course, would deem the property between the
contending parties, of great value, which, twenty-four of the
principal characters of the age, the flower of two counties,
marshalled by two chief officers, were to determine. But what will
he think of the quarrelsome spirit of the times, when, I tell him,
it was only a few acres, which is, even at this day, waste land,
and scarcely worth owning by either.</p>
<p>In 1290, Witton was the property of William Dixley; in 1340,
that of Richard de Pyrie, descendant of him, who, a hundred years
before, held the contest. In 1426, Thomas East, of Hay-hall, in
Yardley, was owner; who sold it to John Bond, of Ward-end, of whose
descendants William Booth purchased it, in 1620: an heiress of
Booth brought it by marriage to Allestree, of Yardley, who enjoyed
it in our days; it was sold to John Wyrley, and is now possessed by
George Birch, Esq; of Handsworth.</p>
<p>The house, left by its owners, is in that low, or rather boggy
situation, suitable to the fashion of those times. I can discover
no traces of a moat, though there is every conveniency for one: We
are doubly hurt by seeing a house in a miserable hole, when joining
an elegible spot.</p>

<h2><a name="BLAKELEY."></a>BLAKELEY.</h2>
<br>
<p>Five miles north-west of Birmingham, is <i>Blakely-hall</i>, the
manor house of Oldbury. If we see a venerable edifice without a
moat, we cannot from thence conclude, it was never the residence of
a gentleman, but wherever we find one, we may conclude it was.</p>
<p>Anciently, this manor, with those of Smethwick and Harborn,
belonged to the family of Cornwallis, whose habitation was
Blakeley-hall: the present building seems about 300 years old.</p>
<p>The extinction of the male line, threw the property into the
hands of two coheirs; one of whom married into the family of
Grimshaw, the other into that of Wright, who jointly held it. The
family of Grimshaw failing, Wright became then, and is now,
possessed of the whole.</p>
<p>I am unacquainted with the principal characters who acted the
farce of life on this island, but it has long been in the tenancy
of a poor farmer, who, the proprietor allured me, was <i>best</i>
able to stock the place with children. In 1769, the Birmingham
canal passing over the premises, robbed the trench of its water.
Whether it endangers the safety is a doubt, for <i>poverty</i> is
the best security against violence.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="WEOLEY"></a>WEOLEY</h2>
<br>
<p>Four miles west of Birmingham, in the parish of Northfield, are
the small, but extensive ruins of <i>Weoley-castle</i>, whose
appendages command a track of seventeen acres, situate in a park of
eighteen hundred.</p>
<p>These moats usually extend from half an acre to two acres, are
generally square, and the trenches from eight yards over to
twenty.</p>
<p>This is large, the walls massy; they form the allies of a
garden, and the rooms, the beds; the whole display the remains of
excellent workmanship. One may nearly guess at a man's consequence,
even after a lapse of 500 years, by the ruins of his house.</p>
<p>The steward told me, "they pulled down the walls as they wanted
the stone." Unfeeling projectors: there is not so much to pull
down. Does not time bring destruction fast enough without
assistance? The head which cannot contemplate, offers its hand to
destroy. The insensible taste, unable itself to relish the dry
fruits of antiquity, throws them away to prevent another. May the
fingers <i>smart</i> which injure the venerable walls of Dudley, or
of Kenilworth. Noble remains of ancient grandeur! copious indexes,
that point to former usage! We survey them with awful pleasure. The
mouldering walls, as if ashamed of their humble state, hide
themselves under the ivies; the generous ivies, as if conscious of
the precious relics, cover them from the injuries of time.</p>
<p>When land frequently undergoes a conveyance, necessity, we
suppose, is the lot of the owner, but the lawyer fattens: <i>To
have and to hold</i> are words of singular import; they charm
beyond music; are the quintessence of language; the leading figure
in rhetoric. But how would he fare if land was never conveyed? He
must starve upon quarrels.</p>
<p>Instances may be given of land which knows no title, except
those of conquest and descent: Weoley Castle comes nearly under
this description. <i>To sign, seal, and deliver</i>, were wholly
unknown to our ancestors. Could a Saxon freeholder rise from the
dead, and visit the land, once his own, now held by as many
writings as would half spread over it, he might exclaim, "Evil
increases with time, and parchment with both. You deprive the poor
of their breeches; I covered the ground with sheep, you with their
skins; I thought, as you were at variance with France, Spain,
Holland, and America, those numerous deeds were a heap of drum
heads, and the internal writing, the <i>articles of war</i>. In one
instance, however, there is a similarity between us; we unjustly
took this land from the Britons, you as unjustly took it from us;
and a time may come, when another will take it from you. Thus, the
Spaniards founded the Peruvian empire in butchery, now tottering
towards a fall; you, following their example, seized the northern
coast of America; you neither bought it nor begged it, you took it
from the natives; and thus your children, the Americans, with equal
violence, have taken it from you: No law binds like that of arms.
The question has been, whether they shall pay taxes? which, after a
dispute of eight years, was lost in another, <i>to whom</i> they
shall pay taxes? The result, in a future day will be, domestic
struggles for sovereignty will stain the ground with blood."</p>
<p>When the proud Norman cut his way to the throne, his imperious
followers seized the lands, kicked out the rightful possessors, and
treated them with a dignity rather beneath that practiced to a
dog.--This is the most summary title yet discovered.</p>
<p>Northfield was the fee-simple of Alwold (Allwood) but, at the
conquest, Fitz-Ausculf seized it, with a multitude of other manors:
it does not appear that he granted it in knight's-service to the
injured Allwood, but kept it for his private use, Paganall married
his heiress, and Sumeri married Paganall's, who, in the beginning
of the 13th century, erected the castle. In 1322, the line of
Sumeri expired.</p>
<p>Bottetourt, one of the needy squires, who, like Sancho Panza,
attended William his master, in his mad, but <i>fortunate</i>
enterprize, procured lands which enabled him to <i>live</i> in
England, which was preferable to starving in Normandy. His
descendant became, in right of his wife, coheir of the house of
Sumeri, vested in Weoley-castle. He had, in 1307, sprung into
peerage, and was one of our powerful barons, till 1385, when the
male line dropt. The vast estate of Bottetourt, was then divided
among females; Thomas Barkley, married the eldest, and this ancient
barony was, in 1761, revived in his descendant, Norborne Barkley,
the present Lord Bottetourt; Sir Hugh Burnel married another, and
Sir John St. Leger a third.</p>
<p>Weoley-castle was, for many years, the undivided estate of the
three families; but Edward Sutton, Lord Dudley, having married a
daughter of Barkley, became possessed of that castle, which was
erected by Sumeri, their common ancestor, about nine generations
before.</p>
<p>In 1551, he sold it to William Jervoise, of London, mercer,
whose descendant, Jervoise Clark Jervoise, Esq; now enjoys it.</p>
<p>Fond of ranging, I have travelled a circuit round Birmingham,
without being many miles from it. I wish to penetrate farther from
the center, but my subject forbids. <i>Having therefore finished my
discourse, I shall</i>, like my friends, the pulpitarians, many of
whom, and of several denominations, are characters I revere,
<i>apply what has been said</i>.</p>
<p>We learn, that the land I have gone over, with the land I have
not, changed its owners at the conquest: this shuts the door of
inquiry into pedigree, the old families chiefly became extinct, and
few of the present can be traced higher.--Destruction then
overspread the kingdom.</p>
<p>The seniors of every age exclaim against the growing corruption
of the times: my father, and perhaps every father, dwelt on the
propriety of his conduct in younger life, and placed it in
counter-view with that of the following generation. However, while
I knew him, it was much like other people's--But I could tell him,
that he gave us the bright side of his character; that he was,
probably, a piece of human nature, as well as his son; that nature
varies but little, and that the age of William the Conqueror was
the most rascally in the British annals. One age may be marked for
the golden, another for the iron, but this for plunder.</p>
<p>We farther learn, there is not one instance in this
neighbourhood, where an estate has continued till now in the male
line, very few in the female. I am acquainted with only one family
near Birmingham, whose ancestor entered with William, and who yet
enjoy the land granted at that period: the male line has been once
broken--perhaps this land was never conveyed. They shone with
splendour near six hundred years. In the sixteenth century, their
estate was about 1400<i>l</i>. a year; great for that time, but is
now, exclusive of a few <i>pepper-corns</i> and <i>red roses</i>,
long since withered, reduced to one little farm, tilled for bread
by the owner. This setting glympse of a shining family, is as
indifferent about the matter, and almost as ignorant, as the team
he drives.</p>
<p>Lastly, we learn that none of the lords, as formerly, reside on
the above premises: that in four instances out of twenty-one, the
buildings are now as left by the lords, Sheldon, Coleshill, Pipe,
and Blakeley: two have undergone some alteration, as Duddeston and
Erdington: five others are re-erected, as Black Greves, Ulverley,
King's-hurst, Castle Bromwich, and Witton; which, with all the
above, are held in tenancy: in eight others all the buildings are
swept away, and their moats left naked, as Hogg's-moat, Yardley,
Kent's-moat, Saltley, Ward-end, Park-hall, Berwood, and Weoley; and
in two instances the moats themselves are vanished, that of
King's-norton is filled up to make way for the plough, and that of
Aston demolished by the floods. Thus the scenes of hospitality and
grandeur, become the scenes of antiquity, and then disappear.</p>

<h2><a name="SUTTON_COLDFIELD."></a>SUTTON COLDFIELD.</h2>
<br>
<p>Though the topographical historian, who resides upon the
premises, is most likely to be correct; yet if <i>he</i>, with all
his care, is apt to be mistaken, what can be expected from him who
trots his horse over the scenes of antiquity?</p>
<p>I have visited, for twenty years, some singular places in this
neighbourhood, yet, without being master of their history; thus a
man may spend an age in conning his lesson, and never learn it.</p>
<p>When the farmer observes me on his territories, he eyes me
<i>ascance</i>; suspecting a design to purchase his farm, or take
it out of his hands.--I endeavour to remove his apprehensions, by
approaching him; and introduce a conversation tending to my
pursuit, which he understands as well as if, like the sons of
Jacob, I addressed him in Hebrew; yet, notwithstanding his total
ignorance of the matter, he has sometimes dropt an accidental word,
which has thrown more light on the subject, than all my researches
for a twelvemonth. If an honest farmer, in future, should see upon
his premises a plumpish figure, five feet six, with one third of
his hair on, a cane in his left hand, a glove upon each, and a
Pomeranian dog at his heels, let him fear no evil; his farm will
not be additionally tythed, his sheep worried, nor his hedges
broken--it is only a solitary animal, in quest of a Roman
phantom.</p>
<p>Upon the north west extremity of Sutton Coldfield, joining the
Chester road, is <i>The Bowen Pool</i>; at the tail of which, one
hundred yards west of the road, on a small eminence, or swell of
the earth, are the remains of a fortification, called <i>Loaches
Banks</i>; but of what use or original is uncertain, no author
having mentioned it.</p>
<p>Four hundred yards farther west, in the same flat, is a hill of
some magnitude, deemed, by the curious, a tumolus--it is a common
thing for an historian to be lost, but not quite so common to
acknowledge it. In attempting to visit this tumolus, I soon found
myself in the center of a morass; and here, my dear reader might
have seen the historian set fast in a double sense. I was obliged,
for that evening, February 16, 1783, to retreat, as the sun had
just done before me. I made my approaches from another quarter,
April 13, when the hill appeared the work of nature, upon too broad
a base for a tumolus; covering about three acres, perfectly round,
rising gradually to the center, which is about sixteen feet above
the level, surrounded by a ditch, perhaps made for some private
purpose by the owner.</p>
<p>The Roman tumoli were of two sorts, the small for the reception
of a general, or great man, as that at Cloudsley-bush, near the
High Cross, the tomb of Claudius; and the large, as at Seckington,
near Tamworth, for the reception of the dead, after a battle: they
are both of the same shape, rather high than broad. That before us
comes under the description of neither; nor could the dead well be
conveyed over the morass.</p>
<p>The ground-plot, in the center of the fort, at Loaches Banks, is
about two acres, surrounded by three mounds, which are large, and
three trenches, which are small; the whole forming a square of four
acres. Each corner directs to a cardinal point, but perhaps not
with design; for the situation of the ground would invite the
operator to chuse the present form. The north-west joins to, and is
secured by the pool.</p>
<p>As the works are much in the Roman taste, I might, at first
view, deem it the residence of an opulent lord of the manor; but,
the adjacent lands carrying no marks of cultivation, destroys the
argument; it is also too large for the fashion; besides, all these
manorial foundations have been in use since the conquest, therefore
tradition assists the historian; but here, tradition being lost,
proves the place of greater antiquity.</p>
<p>One might judge it of Danish extraction, but here again,
tradition will generally lend her assistance; neither are the
trenches large enough for that people: of themselves they are no
security, whether full or empty; for an active young fellow might
easily skip from one bank to another. Nor can we view it as the
work of some whimsical lord, to excite the wonder of the moderns;
it could never pay for the trouble. We must, therefore, travel back
among the ancient Britons, for a solution, and here we shall travel
over solid ground.</p>
<p>It is, probably, the remains of a British camp, for near these
premises are Drude-heath (Druid's-heath) and Drude-fields, which we
may reasonably suppose was the residence of a British priest: the
military would naturally shelter themselves under the wing of the
church, and the priest with the protection of the military. The
narrowness of the trenches is another proof of its being British;
they exactly correspond with the stile of that people. The name of
the pool, <i>Bowen</i>, is of British derivation, which is a
farther proof that the work originated from the Britons. They did
not place their security so much in the trenches, as in the mounds,
which they barracaded with timber. This camp is secured on three
sides by a morass, and is only approachable on the fourth, that
from the Coldfield. The first mound on this weak side, is
twenty-four yards over, twice the size of any other; which,
allowing an ample security, is a farther evidence of its being
British, and tradition being silent is another.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="PETITION_FOR_A_CORPORATION."></a>PETITION FOR A
CORPORATION.</h2>
<br>
<p>Every man upon earth seems fond of two things, riches and power:
this fondness necessarily springs from the heart, otherwise order
would cease. Without the desire of riches, a man would not preserve
what he has, nor provide for the future. "My thoughts," says a
worthy christian, "are not of this world; I desire but one guinea
to carry me through it." Supply him with that guinea, and he wishes
another, lest the first should be defective.</p>
<p>If it is necessary a man mould possess property, it is just as
necessary he should possess a power to protect it, or the world
would quickly bully him out of it: this power is founded on the
laws of his country, to which he adds, by way of supplement,
bye-laws, founded upon his own prudence. Those who possess riches,
well know they are furnished with wings, and can scarcely be kept
from flying.</p>
<p>The man who has power to secure his wealth, seldom stops there;
he, in turn, is apt to triumph over him who has less. Riches and
power are often seen to go hand in hand.</p>
<p>Industry produces property; which, when a little matured, looks
out for command; thus the inhabitants of Birmingham, who have
generally something upon the anvil besides iron, near seventy years
ago having derived wealth from diligence, wished to derive power
from charter; therefore, petitioned the crown that Birmingham might
be erected into a corporation. Tickled with the title of alderman,
dazzled with the splendour of a silver mace, a furred gown, and a
magisterial chair, they could not see the interest of the place:
had they succeeded, that amazing growth would have been crippled,
which has since astonished the world, and those trades have been
fettered which have proved the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>When a man loudly pleads for public good, we shrewdly suspect a
private emolument lurking beneath. There is nothing more
detrimental to good neighbourhood, than men in power, where power
is unnecessary: free as the air we breathe, we subsist by our
freedom; no command is exercised among us, but that of the laws, to
which every discreet citizen pays attention--the magistrate who
distributes justice, tinctured with mercy, merits the thanks of
society. A train of attendants, a white wand, and a few fiddles,
are only the fringe, lace, and trappings of charteral office.</p>
<p>Birmingham, exclusive of her market, ranks among the very lowest
order of townships; every petty village claims the honour of being
a constable-wick--we are no more. Our immunities are only the
trifling privileges anciently granted to the lords; and two thirds
of these are lost. But, notwithstanding this seemingly forlorn
state, perhaps there is not a place in the British dominions, where
so many people are governed by so few officers; nor a place better
governed: pride, therefore, must have dictated the humble petition
before us.</p>
<p>I have seen a copy of this petition, signed by eighty-four of
the inhabitants; and though without a date, seems to have been
addressed to King George the First, about 1716: it alledges, "That
Birmingham is, of late years, become very populous, from its great
increase of trade; is much superior to any town in the county, and
but little inferior to any inland town in the kingdom: that it is
governed only by a constable, and enjoys no more privileges than a
village: that there is no justice of peace in the town; nor any in
the neighbourhood, who dares act with vigour: that the country
abounds with rioters, who, knowing the place to be void of
magistrates, assemble in it, pull down the meeting-houses, defy the
king, openly avow the pretender, threaten the inhabitants, and
oblige them to keep watch in their own houses: that the trade
decays, and will stagnate, if not relieved. To remedy these evils,
they beseech his majesty to incorporate the town, and grant such
privileges as will enable them to support their trade, the king's
interest, and destroy the villainous attempts of the jacobites. In
consideration of the requested charter, they make the usual
offering of <i>lives</i> and <i>fortunes</i>".</p>
<p>A petition and the petitioner, like Janus with his two faces,
looks different ways; it is often treated as if it said one thing,
and meant another; or as if it said any thing but truth. Its use,
in some places, is to <i>lie on the table</i>. Our humble petition,
by some means, met with the fate it deserved.</p>
<p>We may remark, a town without a charter, is a town without a
shackle. If there was then a necessity to erect a corporation,
because the town was large, there is none now, though larger: the
place was not better governed a thousand years ago, when only a
tenth of its present magnitude; it may also be governed as well a
thousand years hence, if it should swell to ten times its size.</p>
<p>The <i>pride</i> of our ancestors was hurt by a petty constable;
the <i>interest</i> of us, their successors, would be hurt by a
mayor: a more simple government cannot be instituted, or one more
efficacious: that of some places is designed for parade, ours for
use; and both answers their end. A town governed by a multitude of
governors, is the most likely to be ill-governed.</p>

<h2><a name="BRASS_WORKS."></a>BRASS WORKS.</h2>
<br>
<p>The manufacture of brass was introduced by the family of Turner,
about 1740, who erected those works at the south end of
Coleshill-street; then, near two hundred yards beyond the
buildings, but now the buildings extend about five hundred beyond
them.</p>
<p>Under the black clouds which arose from this corpulent tunnel,
some of the trades collected their daily supply of brass; but the
major part was drawn from the Macclesfield, Cheadle, and Bristol
companies.</p>
<p>'Causes are known by their effects;' the fine feelings of the
heart are easily read in the features of the face: the still
operations of the mind, are discovered by the rougher operations of
the hand.</p>
<p>Every creature is fond of power, from that noble head of the
creation, man, who devours man, down to that insignificant mite,
who devours his cheese: every man strives to be free himself, and
to shackle another.</p>
<p>Where there is power of any kind, whether in the hands of a
prince, a people, a body of men, or a private person, there is a
propensity to abuse it: abuse of power will everlastingly seek
itself a remedy, and frequently find it; nay, even this remedy may
in time degenerate to abuse, and call loudly for another.</p>
<p>Brass is an object of some magnitude, in the trades of
Birmingham; the consumption is said to be a thousand tons per
annum. The manufacture of this useful article had long been in few,
and opulent hands; who, instead of making the humble bow, for
favours received, acted with despotic sovereignty, established
their own laws, chose their customers, directed the price, and
governed the market.</p>
<p>In 1780, the article rose, either through caprice, or necessity,
perhaps the <i>former</i>, from 72<i>l</i>. a ton to 84<i>l</i>.
the result was, an advance upon the goods manufactured, followed by
a number of counter-orders, and a stagnation of business.</p>
<p>In 1781, a person, from affection to the user, or resentment to
the maker, perhaps, the <i>latter</i>, harangued the public in the
weekly papers; censured the arbitrary measures of the brazen
sovereigns, shewed their dangerous influence over the trades of the
town, and the easy manner in which works of our own might be
constructed--good often arises out of evil; this fiery match, dipt
in brimstone, quickly kindled another furnace in Birmingham. Public
meetings were advertised, a committee appointed, and subscriptions
opened to fill two hundred shares, of 100<i>l</i>. each, deemed a
sufficient capital: each proprietor of a share, to purchase one ton
of brass, annually. Works were immediately erected upon the banks
of the canal, for the advantage of water carriage, and the whole
was conducted with the true spirit of Birmingham freedom.</p>
<p>If a man can worm himself <i>into</i> a lucrative branch, he
will use every method to keep another <i>out</i>. All his powers
may prove ineffectual; for if that other smells the sweet profits
of the first, <i>he</i> will endeavour to worm himself <i>in</i>:
both may suffer by the contest, and the public be gainers.</p>
<p>The old companies, which we may justly consider the directors of
a south sea bubble in miniature, sunk the price from 84<i>l</i>. to
56<i>l</i>. Two inferences arise from this measure; that their
profits were once very high, or are now very low; and, like some
former monarchs, in the abuse of power, they repented one day too
late.</p>
<p>Schemes are generally proclaimed, <i>for public good!</i> but as
often meant, <i>for private interest</i>.--This, however, varied
from that rule, and seemed less calculated to benefit those
immediately, than those remotely concerned: they chose to sustain a
smaller injury from making brass, than a greater from the
makers.</p>

<h2><a name="PRISON."></a>PRISON.</h2>
<br>
<p>If the subject is little, but little can be said upon it; I
shall shine as dimly in this chapter on confinement, as in that on
government. The traveller who sets out lame, will probably limp
through the journey.</p>
<p>Many of my friends have assured me, "That I must have
experienced much trouble in writing the history of Birmingham." But
I assure them in return, that I range those hours among the
happiest of my life; and part of that happiness may consist in
delineating the bright side of human nature. Pictures of deformity,
whether of body or of mind, disgust--the more they approach towards
beauty, the more they charm.</p>
<p>All the chapters which compose this work, were formed with
pleasure, except the latter part of that upon <i>births and
burials</i>; there, being forced to apply to the parish books, I
<i>figured</i> with some obstruction. Poor <i>Allsop</i>, full of
good-nature and affliction, fearful lest I should sap the church,
could not receive me with kindness. When a man's resources lie
within himself, he draws at pleasure; but when necessity throws him
upon the parish, he draws in small sums, and with difficulty.</p>
<p>I either <i>have</i>, or <i>shall</i> remark, for I know not in
what nich I shall exhibit this posthumous chapter, drawn like one
of our sluggish bills, <i>three months after date</i>, "That
Birmingham does not abound in villainy, equal to some other places:
that the hand employed in business, has less time, and less
temptation, to be employed in mischief; and that one magistrate
alone, corrected the enormities of this numerous people, many years
before I knew them, and twenty-five after." I add, that the ancient
lords of Birmingham, among their manorial privileges, had the grant
of a gallows, for capital punishment; but as there are no traces
even of the name, in the whole manor, I am persuaded no such thing
was ever erected, and perhaps the <i>anvil</i> prevented it.</p>
<p>Many of the rogues among us are not of our own growth, but are
drawn hither, as in London, to shelter in a crowd, and the easier
in that crowd to pursue their game. Some of them fortunately catch,
from example, the arts of industry, and become useful: others
continue to cheat for one or two years, till frightened by the grim
aspect of justice, they decamp.</p>
<p>Our vile and obscure prison, termed <i>The Dungeon</i>, is a
farther proof how little that prison has been an object of notice,
consequently of use.</p>
<p>Anciently the lord of a manor exercised a sovereign power in his
little dominion; held a tribunal on his premises, to which was
annexed a prison, furnished with implements for punishment; these
were claimed by the lords of Birmingham. This crippled species of
jurisprudence, which sometimes made a man judge in his own cause,
from which there was no appeal, prevailed in the highlands of
Scotland, so late as the rebellion in 1745, when the peasantry, by
act of parliament, were restored to freedom.</p>
<p>Early perhaps in the sixteenth century, when the house of
Birmingham, who had been chief gaolers, were fallen, a building was
erected, which covered the east end of New-street, called the
Leather-hall: the upper part consisted of a room about fifty feet
long, where the public business of the manor was transacted. The
under part was divided into several: one of these small rooms was
used for a prison: but about the year 1728, <i>while men slept an
enemy came</i>, a private agent to the lord of the manor, and
erazed the Leather-hall and the Dungeon, erected three houses on
the spot, and received their rents till 1776, when the town
purchased them for 500<i>l</i>. to open the way. A narrow passage
on the south will be remembered for half a century to come, by the
name of the <i>dungeon-entry</i>.</p>
<p>A dry cellar, opposite the demolished hall, was then
appropriated for a prison, till the town of all bad places chose
the worst, the bottom of Peck-lane; dark, narrow, and unwholesome
within; crowded with dwellings, filth and distress without, the
circulation of air is prevented.</p>
<p>As a growing taste for public buildings has for some time
appeared among us, we might, in the construction of a prison, unite
elegance and use; and the west angle of that land between
New-street and Mount-pleasant, might be suitable for the purpose;
an airy spot in the junction of six streets. The proprietor of the
land, from his known attachment to Birmingham, would, I doubt not,
be much inclined to grant a favour.--Thus, I have expended ten
<i>score</i> words, to tell the world what another would have told
them in <i>ten</i>--"That our prison is wretched, and we want a
better."</p>

<h2><a name="CLODSHALES_CHANTRY."></a>CLODSHALES CHANTRY.</h2>
<br>
<p>It is an ancient remark, "The world is a farce." Every
generation, and perhaps every individual, acts a part in disguise;
but when the curtain falls, the hand of the historian pulls off the
mask, and displays the character in its native light. Every
generation differs from the other, <i>yet all are right</i>. Time,
fashion, and sentiment change together. We laugh at the oddity of
our fore-fathers--our successors will laugh at us.</p>
<p>The prosperous anvil of Walter de Clodshale, a native of this
place, had enabled him to acquire several estates in Birmingham, to
purchase the lordship of Saltley, commence gentleman, and reside in
the manor-house, now gone to decay, though its traces remain, and
are termed by common people, <i>the Giant's Castle</i>. This man,
having well provided for the <i>present</i>, thought it prudent, at
the close of life, to provide for the <i>future</i>: he therefore
procured a licence, in 1331, from William de Birmingham, lord of
the see, and another from the crown, to found a chantry at the
altar in St. Martin's church, for one priest, to pray for his soul,
and that of his wife.</p>
<p>He gave, that he might be safely wafted into the arms of
felicity, by the breath of a priest, four houses, twenty acres of
land, and eighteen-pence rent, issuing out of his estates in
Birmingham.</p>
<p>The same righteous motive induced his son Richard, in 1348, to
grant five houses, ten acres of land, and ten shillings rent, from
the Birmingham estates, to maintain a second priest, who was to
secure the souls of himself and his wife. The declaration of
Christ, in that pious age, seems to have been inverted; for instead
of its being difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
heaven, it was difficult for him to miss it. We are not told what
became of him who had nothing to give! If the profits of the estate
tended the right way, perhaps there was no great concern which way
either <i>Walter</i> or <i>Richard</i> tended.</p>
<p>The chantorial music continued two hundred and four years, till
1535, when Henry the Eighth closed the book, turned out the
priests, who were Sir Thomas Allen and Sir John Green, and seized
the property, valued at 5<i>l</i>. 1s. per annum. Permit me again
to moralize upon this fashionable practice of ruining the family,
for the health of the soul: except some lawful creditor puts in a
claim, which justice ought to allow, a son has the same right to an
estate, after the death of his father, as that father had before
him.</p>
<p>Had Walter and Richard taken <i>equal</i> care of their souls,
and their estate, the first might have been as safe as in the hands
of a priest, and the last, at this day, have been the property of
that ancient, and once noble race of Arden, long since in distress;
who, in 1426, married the heiress of their house.--Thus, a family,
benefited by the hammer, was injured by the church.</p>
<p>Had the hands of these two priests ministered to their wants, in
the construction of tents and fishing-nets, like those of their
predecessors, St. Paul and St. Peter, though their pride would have
been eclipsed, their usefulness would have shone, and the world
have been gainers by their labour. Two other lessons may be learnt
from this little ecclesiastical history--</p>
<p>The astonishing advance of landed property in Birmingham: nine
houses, and thirty acres of land, two hundred and fifty years ago,
were valued at the trifling rent of 4<i>l</i>. 9s. 6d. per annum;
one of the acres, or one of the houses, would at this day bring
more. We may reasonably suppose they were under-rated; yet, even
then, the difference is amasing. An acre, within a mile of
Birmingham, now sells for about one hundred pounds, and lets from
three pounds to five, some as high as seven.</p>
<p>And, the nation so overswarmed with ecclesiastics, that the
spiritual honours were quickly devoured, and the race left hungry;
they therefore fastened upon the temporal--hence we boast of two
knighted priests.</p>

<h2><a name="OCCURRENCES."></a>OCCURRENCES.</h2>
<h3>EARTHQUAKE, &amp;c.</h3>
<br>
<p>It is a doctrine singular and barbarous, but it is nevertheless
true, that <i>destruction is necessary</i>. Every species of
animals would multiply beyond their bounds in the creation, were
not means devised to thin their race.</p>
<p>I perused an author in 1738, who asserts, "The world might
maintain sixty times the number of its present inhabitants." Two
able disputants, like those in religion, might maintain sixty
arguments on the subject, and like them, leave the matter where
they found it. But if restraint was removed, the present number
would be multiplied into sixty, in much less than one century.</p>
<p>Those animals appropriated for use, are suffered, or rather
invited, to multiply without limitation. But <i>luxury</i> cuts off
the beast, the pig, the sheep, and the fowl, and ill treatment the
horse: vermin of every kind, from the lion to the louse, are hunted
to death; a perpetual contest seems to exist between them and us;
they for their preservation, and we for their extinction. The
kitten and the puppy are cast <i>into</i> the water, to end their
lives; <i>out</i> of which the fishes are drawn to end
theirs--animals are every were devoured by animals.</p>
<p>Their grand governor, man himself, is under controul; some by
religious, others by interested motives. Even the fond parent,
seldom wishes to increase the number of those objects, which of all
others he values most!</p>
<p>In civilized nations the superior class are restrained by the
laws of honour, the inferior by those of bastardy; but,
notwithstanding these restraints, the human race would increase
beyond measure, were they not taken off by casualties. It is in our
species alone, that we often behold the infant flame extinguished
by the wretched nurse.</p>
<p>Three dreadful calamities attending existence, are inundations,
fires, and earthquakes; devestation follows their footsteps, But
<i>one</i> calamity, more destructive than them all, rises from man
himself, <i>war</i>.</p>
<p>Birmingham, from its elevation, is nearly exempt from the flood;
our inundations, instead of sweeping away life and fortune, sweep
away the filth from the kennel.</p>
<p>It is amasing, in a place crowded with people, that so
<i>much</i> business, and so <i>little</i> mischief is done by
fire: we abound more with party walls, than with timber buildings.
Utensils are ever ready to extinguish the flames, and a generous
spirit to use them. I am not certain that a conflagration of
50<i>l</i>. damage, has happened within memory.</p>
<p>I have only one earthquake to record, felt Nov. 15, 1772, at
four in the morning; it extended about eight miles in length, from
Hall-green to Erdington, and four in breadth, of which Birmingham
was part. The shaking of the earth continued about five seconds,
with unequal vibration, sufficient to awake a gentle sleeper, throw
down a knife carelessly reared up, or rattle the brass drops of a
chest of drawers. A flock of sheep, in a field near Yardley,
frightened at the trembling, ran away.--No damage was
sustained.</p>

<h2><a name="PITMORE_AND_HAMMOND."></a>PITMORE AND HAMMOND.</h2>
<br>
<p>Thomas Pitmore, a native of Cheshire, after consuming a fortune
of 700<i>l</i>. was corporal in the second regiment of foot; and
John Hammond, an American by birth, was drummer in the
thirty-sixth; both of recruiting parties in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Having procured a brace of pistols, they committed several
robberies in the dark, on the highways.</p>
<p>At eight in the evening of November 22, 1780, about five hundred
yards short of the four mile-stone, in the Coleshill road, they met
three butchers of Birmingham, who closely followed each other in
their return from Rugby fair. One of the robbers attempted the
bridle of the first man, but his horse, being young, started out of
the road, and ran away. The drummer then attacked the second,
Wilfred Barwick, with "Stop your horse," and that moment, through
the agitation of a timorous mind, discharged a pistol, and lodged a
brace of slugs in the bowels of the unfortunate Barwick, who
exclaimed, "I am a dead man!" and fell.</p>
<p>The corporal instantly disappeared, and was afterwards, by the
light of the show upon the ground, seen retreating to Birmingham.
The drummer ran forwards about forty yards, and over a stile into
Ward-end field. A fourth butcher of their company, and a lad, by
this time came up, who, having heard the report of a pistol, seen
the flash, and the drummer enter the field, leaped over the hedge
in pursuit of the murderer. A frey ensued, in which the drummer was
seized, who desired them not to take his life, but leave him to the
laws of his country.</p>
<p>Within half an hour, the deceased and the captive appeared
together in the same room, at the Horse-shoe. What must then be the
feelings of a mind, susceptible of impression by nature, but weakly
calloused over by art? This is one instance, among many, which
shews us, a life of innocence, is alone a life of happiness.</p>
<p>The drummer impeached his companion, who was perhaps the most
guilty of the two, and they were both that night lodged in the
dungeon.</p>
<p>Upon the trial, March 31, 1781, the matter was too plain to be
controverted. The criminals were executed, and hung in chains at
Washwood-heath, April 2; the corporal at the age of 25, and the
drummer 22.</p>

<h2><a name="RIOTS."></a>RIOTS.</h2>
<br>
<p>Three principal causes of riot are, the low state of wages, the
difference in political sentiment, and the rise of provisions:
these causes, like inundations, produce dreadful effects, and like
them, return at uncertain periods.</p>
<p>The journeyman in Birmingham is under no temptation to demand an
additional price for his labour, which is already higher than the
usual mark.</p>
<p>There is no nation fonder of their king than the English; which
is a proof that monarchy suits the genius of the people: there is
no nation more jealous of his power, which proves that liberty is a
favourite maxim. Though the laws have complimented him with
<i>much</i>, yet he well knows, a prerogative upon the stretch, is
a prerogative in a dangerous state.</p>
<p>The more a people value their prince, the more willing are they
to contend in his favour.</p>
<p>The people of England revered the memory of their beloved Saxon
kings, and doubly lamented their fall, with that of their
liberties.</p>
<p>They taxed themselves into beggary, to raise the amasing sum of
100,000<i>l</i>. to release Richard the First, unjustly taken
captive by Leopold.</p>
<p>They protected Henry the Fifth from death, at Agincourt, and
received that death themselves.</p>
<p>They covered the extreme weakness of Henry the Sixth, who
<i>never said a good thing, or did a bad one</i>, with the mantle
of royalty; when a character like his, without a crown, would have
been hunted through life: they gave him the title of <i>good king
Henry</i>, which would well have suited, had the word <i>king</i>
been omitted; they sought him a place in the kalendar of saints,
and made <i>him</i> perform the miracles of an angel when dead, who
could never perform the works of a man, when living.</p>
<p>The people shewed their attachment to Henry the Eighth, by
submitting to the faggot and the block, at his command; and with
their last breath, praying for their butcher.</p>
<p>Affection for Charles the First, induced four of his friends to
offer their own heads, to save his.--The wrath, and the tears of
the people, succeeded his melancholy exit.</p>
<p>When James the Second eloped from the throne, and was casually
picked up at Feversham, by his injured subjects, <i>they remembered
he was their king</i>.</p>
<p>The church and Queen Anne, like a joyous co-partnership, were
toasted together. The barrel was willingly emptied to honour the
queen, and the toaster lamented he could honour her no more.</p>
<p>The nation displayed their love to Charles the Second, by
latticing the forests. His climbing the oak at Boscobel, has been
the destruction of more timber than would have filled the harbour
of Portsmouth; the tree which flourished in the field, was brought
to die in the street. Birmingham, for ninety years, honoured him
with her vengeance against the woods; and she is, at this day,
surrounded with mutilated oaks, which stand as martyrs to
royalty.</p>
<p>It is singular, that the oak, which assisted the devotion of the
Britons, composed habitations for the people, and furniture for
those habitations; that, while standing, was an ornament to the
country that bore it; and afterwards guarded the land which nursed
it, should be the cause of continual riots, in the reign of George
the First. We could not readily accede to a line of strangers, in
preference to our ancient race of kings, though loudly charged with
oppression.</p>
<p>Clubs and tumults supported the spirit of contention till 1745,
when, as our last act of animosity, we crowned an ass with turnips,
in derision of one of the worthiest families that ever eat
them.</p>
<p>Power, in the hand of ignorance, is an edge-tool of the most
dangerous kind. The scarcity of provisions, in 1766, excited the
murmurs of the poor. They began to breathe vengeance against the
farmer, miller, and baker, for doing what they do themselves,
procure the greatest price for their property.</p>
<p>On the market day, a common labourer, like Massenello of Naples,
formed the resolution to lead a mob.</p>
<p>He therefore erected his standard, which was a mop inverted,
assembled the crowd, and roared out the old note, "Redress of
Grievances." The colliers, with all their dark retinue, were to
bring destruction from Wednesbury. Amazement seised the town! the
people of fortune trembled: John Wyrley, an able magistrate, for
the first time frightened in office, with quivering lips, and a
pale aspect, swore in about eighty constables, to oppose the rising
storm, armed each of them with a staff of authority, warm from the
turning-lathe, and applied to the War-office for a military
force.</p>
<p>The lime-powdered monarch began to fabricate his own laws,
direct the price of every article, which was punctually obeyed.</p>
<p>Port, or power, soon overcome a weak head; the more copious the
draught, the more quick intoxication: he entered many of the shops,
and was every where treated with the utmost reverence; took
whatever goods he pleased, and distributed them among his
followers; till one of the inhabitants, provoked beyond measure at
his insolence, gave him a hearty kick on the posteriors, when the
hero and his consequence, like that of Wat Tyler, fell
together.--Thus ended a reign of seven hours; the sovereign was
committed to prison, as sovereigns ought, in the abuse of power,
and harmony was restored without blood.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CONJURERS."></a>THE CONJURERS.</h2>
<br>
<p>No <i>head</i> is a vacuum. Some, like a paltry cottage, are ill
accommodated, dark, and circumscribed; others are capacious as
Westminster-Hall. Though none are immense, yet they are capable of
immense furniture. The more room is taken up by knowledge, the less
remains for credulity. The more a man is acquainted with things,
the more willing to <i>give up the ghost</i>. Every town and
village, within my knowledge, has been pestered with spirits; which
appear in horrid forms to the imagination in the winter night--but
the spirits which haunt Birmingham, are those of industry and
luxury.</p>
<p>If we examine the whole parish, we cannot produce one <i>old</i>
witch; but we have plenty of young, who exercise a powerful
influence over us. Should the ladies accuse the harsh epithet, they
will please to consider, I allow them, what of all things they most
wish for, <i>power</i>, therefore the balance is in my favor.</p>
<p>If we pass through the planitary worlds, we shall be able to
muster up two conjurers, who endeavoured to <i>shine with the
stars</i>. The first, John Walton, who was so busy in calling the
nativity of others, he forgot his own.</p>
<p>Conscious of an application to himself, for the discovery of
stolen goods, he employed his people to steal them. And though, for
many years confined to his bed by infirmity, he could conjure away
the property of others, and, for a reward, reconjure it again.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this evil, induced the legislature, in 1725,
to make the <i>reception</i> of stolen goods capital. The first
sacrifice to this law was the noted Jonathan Wild.</p>
<p>The officers of justice, in 1732, pulled Walton out of his bed,
in an obscure cottage, one furlong from the town, now
Brickhill-Lane, carried him to prison, and from thence to the
gallows--they had better have carried him to the workhouse, and his
followers to the anvil.</p>
<p>To him succeeded Francis Kimberley, the only reasoning animal,
who resided at No. 60, in Dale-End, from his early youth to extreme
age.--An hermit in a crowd! The windows of his house were strangers
to light! The shutters forgot to open; the chimney to smoak. His
cellar, though amply furnished, never knew moisture.</p>
<p>He spent threescore years in filling six rooms with such
trumpery as is just too good to be thrown away, and too bad to be
kept. His life was as inoffensive as long. Instead of
<i>stealing</i> the goods which other people use, he
<i>purchased</i> what he could not use himself. He was not anxious
what kind of property entered his house; if there was <i>bulk</i>
he was satisfied.</p>
<p>His dark house, and his dark figure corresponded with each
other. The apartments, choaked up with lumber, scarcely admitted
his body, though of the skeleton order. Perhaps leanness is an
appendage to the science, for I never knew a corpulent
conjurer.</p>
<p>His diet, regular, plain, and slender, shewed at how little
expence life may be sustained.</p>
<p>His library consisted of several thousand volumes, not one of
which, I believe, he ever read: having written, in characters
unknown to all but himself, his name, price, and date, in the
title-page, he laid them by for ever. The highest pitch of his
erudition was the annual almanack.</p>
<p>He never wished to approach a woman, or be approached by one.
Should the rest of men, for half a century, pay no more attention
to the fair, some angelic hand might stick up a note, like the
artic circle over one of our continents, <i>this world to be
let</i>.</p>
<p>If he did not cultivate the human species, the spiders, more
numerous than his books, enjoyed an uninterrupted reign of quiet.
The silence of the place was not broken: the broom, the book, the
dust, or the web, was not disturbed. Mercury and his shirt, changed
their revolutions together; and Saturn changed <i>his</i>, with his
coat.</p>
<p>He died, in 1756, as conjurers usually die, unlamented.</p>

<h2><a name="MILITARY_ASSOCIATION."></a>MILITARY ASSOCIATION.</h2>
<br>
<p>The use of arms is necessary to every man who has something to
lose, or something to gain. No property will protect itself. The
English have liberty and property to lose, but nothing to win. As
every man is born free, the West-Indian slaves have liberty to
gain, but nothing to lose. If a rascally African prince attempts to
sell his people, he ought to be first sold himself; and the buyer,
who acts so daringly opposite to the Christian precept, is yet more
blameable. He ought to have the first whip, often mended, worn out
upon his own back.</p>
<p>It may seem unnecessary to tell the world, what they already
know; recent transactions come under this description; but they are
not known to the stranger, nor to posterity.</p>
<p>Upon a change of the Northean ministry, in 1782, the new
premier, in a circular letter, advised the nation to arm, as the
dangers of invasion threatened us with dreadful aspect.
Intelligence from a quarter so authentic, locked up the door of
private judgment, or we might have considered, that even without
alliance, and with four principal powers upon our hands, we were
rather gaining ground; that the Americans were so far from
attacking us, that they wished us to run ourselves out of breath to
attack them; that Spain had slumbered over a seven years war; that
the Dutch, provoked at their governors, for the loss of their
commerce, were more inclinable to invade themselves than us; and
that as France bore the weight of the contest, we found employment
for her arms, without invasion; but, perhaps, the letter was only
an artifice of the new state doctor, to represent his patient in a
most deplorable state, as a complement to his own merit in
recovering her.</p>
<p>Whatever was the cause, nothing could be more agreeable than
this letter to the active spirit of Birmingham. Public meetings
were held. The rockets of war were squibbed off in the news-papers.
The plodding tradesman and the lively hero assembled together in
arms, and many a trophy was won in thought.</p>
<p>Each man purchased a genteel blue uniform, decorated with
epaulets of gold, which, together with his accoutrements, cost
about 17<i>l</i>. The gentleman, the apprentice, &amp;c. to the
number of seventy, united in a body, termed by themselves, <i>The
Birmingham Association</i>; by the wag, <i>the brazen walls of the
town</i>. Each was to be officer and private by ballet, which gives
an idea of equality, and was called to exercise once a week.</p>
<p>The high price of provisions, and the 17th of October, brought a
dangerous mob into Birmingham. They wanted bread: so did we. But
little conference passed between them and the inhabitants. They
were quiet; we were pleased; and, after an hour or two's stay, they
retreated in peace.</p>
<p>In the evening, after the enemy were fled, our champions beat to
arms, breathing vengeance against the hungry crew; and, had they
returned, some people verily thought our valiant heroes would have
<i>discharged</i> at them.</p>
<p>However laudable a system, if built upon a false basis, it will
not stand. Equality and command, in the same person, are
incompatiable; therefore, cannot exist together. Subordination is
necessary in every class of life, but particularly in the military.
Nothing but severe discipline can regulate the boisterous spirit of
an army.</p>
<p>A man may be bound to another, but if he commands the bandage,
he will quickly set himself free. This was the case with the
military association. As their uniform resembled that of a
commander, so did their temper. There were none to submit. The
result was, the farce ended, and the curtain dropt in December, by
a quarrel with each other; and, like <i>John</i> and
<i>Lilborn</i>, almost with themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="BILSTON_CANAL_ACT."></a>BILSTON CANAL ACT.</h2>
<br>
<p>Envy, like a dark shadow, follows closely the footsteps of
prosperity; success in any undertaking, out of the circle of
genius, produces a rival.--This I have instanced in our hackney
coaches.</p>
<p>Profits, like a round-bellied bottle, may seem bulky, which,
like that, will not bear dividing: Thus Orator Jones, in 1774,
opened a debating society at the Red Lion; he quickly filled a
large room with customers, and his pockets with money, but he had
not prudence to keep either. His success opened a rival society at
the King's-head, which, in a few weeks, annihilated both.</p>
<p>The growing profits of our canal company, already mentioned, had
increased the shares from 140<i>l</i>. in 1768, to 400 guineas, in
1782. These emoluments being thought enormous, a rival company
sprung up, which, in 1783, petitioned Parliament to partake of
those emoluments, by opening a parallel cut from some of the
neighbouring coal-pits; to proceed along the lower level, and
terminate in Digbeth.</p>
<p>A stranger might ask, "How the water in our upland country,
which had never supplied one canal, could supply two? Whether the
second canal was not likely to rob the first? Whether one able
canal is not preferable to two lame ones? If a man sells me an
article cheaper than I can purchase it elsewhere, whether it is of
consequence to me what are his profits? And whether two companies
in rivalship would destroy that harmony which has long subsisted in
Birmingham."</p>
<p>The new company urged, "The necessity of another canal, lest the
old should not perform the business of the town; that twenty per
cent. are unreasonable returns; that they could afford coals under
the present price; that the south country teams would procure a
readier supply from Digbeth, than from the present wharf, and not
passing through the streets, would be prevented from injuring the
pavement; and that the goods from the Trent would come to their
wharf by a run of eighteen miles nearer than to the other."</p>
<p>The old company alledged, "That they ventured their property in
an uncertain pursuit, which, had it not succeeded, would have
ruined many individuals; therefore the present gains were only a
recompense for former hazard: that this property was expended upon
the faith of Parliament, who were obliged in honour to protect it,
otherwise no man would risk his fortune upon a public undertaking;
for should they allow a second canal, why not a third; which would
become a wanton destruction of right, without benefit; that
although the profit of the original subscribers might seem large,
those subscribers are but few; many have bought at a subsequent
price, which barely pays common interest, and this is all their
support; therefore a reduction would be barbarous on one side, and
sensibly felt on the other: and, as the present canal amply
supplies the town and country, it would be ridiculous to cut away
good land to make another, which would ruin both."</p>
<p>I shall not examine the reasons of either, but leave the
disinterested reader to weigh both in his own balance.</p>
<p>When two opponents have said all that is true, they generally
say something more; rancour holds the place of argument.</p>
<p>Both parties beat up for volunteers in the town, to strengthen
their forces; from words of acrimony, they came to those of
virulence; then the powerful batteries of hand-bills, and
news-papers were opened: every town within fifty miles, interested,
on either side, was moved to petition, and both prepared for a
grand attack, confident of victory.</p>
<p>Perhaps a contest among friends, in matters of property, will
remove that peace of mind, which twenty per cent. will not
replace.</p>
<p>Each party possessed that activity of spirit, for which
Birmingham is famous, and seemed to divide between them the
legislative strength of the nation: every corner of the two houses
was ransacked for a vote; the throne was the only power
unsolicited. Perhaps at the reading, when both parties had
marshalled their forces, there was the fullest House of Commons
ever remembered on a private bill.</p>
<p>The new company promised much, for besides the cut from
Wednesbury to Digbeth, they would open another to join the two
canals of Stafford and Coventry, in which a large track of country
was interested.</p>
<p>As the old company were the first adventurers, the house gave
them the option to perform this Herculean labour, which they
accepted.</p>
<p>As parliament have not yet given their determination, and as the
printer this moment raps at my door, "Sir, the press waits, more
copy if you please," I cannot stay to tell the world the result of
the bill; but perhaps, the new proprietors, by losing, will save
50,000<i>l</i>. and the old, by winning, become sufferers.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="WORKHOUSE_BILL."></a>WORKHOUSE BILL.</h2>
<br>
<p>I have often mentioned an active spirit, as the characteristic
of the inhabitants of Birmingham. This spirit never forsakes them.
It displays itself in industry, commerce, invention, humanity, and
internal government. A singular vivacity attends every pursuit till
compleated, or discarded for a second.</p>
<p>The bubble of the day, like that at the end of a tobacco-pipe,
dances in air, exhibits divers beauties, pleases the eye, bursts in
a moment, and is followed up by another.</p>
<p>There is no place in the British dominions easier to be governed
than Birmingham; and yet we are fond of forging acts of parliament
to govern her.</p>
<p>There is seldom a point of time in which an act is not in
agitation; we fabricate them with such expedition, that we could
employ a parliament of our own to pass them. But, to the honor of
our ladies, not one of these acts is directed against them. Neither
is there an instance upon record, that the torch of Hymen was ever
extinguished by the breath of Marriot in Doctors-Commons.</p>
<p>In the present spring of 1783, we have four acts upon the anvil:
every man, of the least consequence, becomes a legislator, and
wishes to lend his assistance in framing an act; so that instead of
one lord, as formerly, we now, like the Philistines, have three
thousand.</p>
<p>An act of parliament, abstractedly considered, is a dead matter:
it cannot operate of itself: like a plaister, it must be applied to
the evil, or that evil will remain. We vainly expect a law to
perform the intended work; if it does not, we procure another to
make it. Thus the canal, by one act in 1767, hobbled on, like a man
with one leg; but a second, in 1770, furnished a pair. The lamp
act, procured in 1769, was worn to rags, and mended with another in
1773; and this second has been long out of repair, and waits for a
third.</p>
<p>We carry the same spirit into our bye-laws, and with the same
success. Schemes have been devised, to oblige every man to pay
levies; but it was found difficult to extract money from him who
had none.</p>
<p>In 1754, we brought the manufacture of pack-thread into the
workhouse, to reduce the levies; the levies increased. A spirited
overseer afterwards, for the same reason, as if poverty was not a
sufficient stigma, badged the poor; the levies still increased.</p>
<p>The advance of bread in 1756, induced the officers to step out
of the common track, perhaps, out of their knowledge; and, at the
expence of half a levy, fit up an apparatus for grinding corn in
the house: thus, by sacrificing half <i>one levy, many would be
saved</i>. However, in the pursuit, many happened to be lost. In
1761, the apparatus was sold at a farther loss; and the overseers
sheltered themselves under the charge of idleness against the
paupers.</p>
<p>In 1766, the spinning of mop-yarn was introduced, which might,
with attention, have turned to account; but unfortunately, the yarn
proved of less value than the wool.</p>
<p>Others, with equal wisdom, were to ease the levies, by feeding a
drove of pigs, which, agreeable to their own nature--ran
backwards.--Renting a piece of ground, by way of garden, which
supplied the house with a pennyworth of vegetables, for two-pence,
adding a few cows, and a pasture; but as the end of all was
<i>loss</i>, the levies increased.</p>
<p>In 1780, two collectors were appointed, at fifty guineas each,
which would save the town <i>many a hundred</i>; still the levies
increased.</p>
<p>A petition is this sessions presented, for an Act to overturn
the whole pauper system (for our heads are as fond of new fashions,
in parochial government, as in the hats which cover them) to erect
a superb workhouse, at the expence of 10,000<i>l</i>. with powers
to borrow 15,000<i>l</i>. which grand design is to reduce the
levies <i>one third</i>.--The levies will increase.</p>
<p>The reasons <i>openly</i> alledged are, "The Out-pensioners,
which cost 7000<i>l</i>. a year, are the chief foundation of our
public grievances: that the poor ought to be employed <i>in</i> the
house, lest their morals become injured by the shops; which
prevents them from being taken into family service; and, the
crowded state of the workhouse."--But whether the pride of an
overseer, in perpetuating his name, is not the pendulum which set
the machine in motion? Or, whether a man, as well as a spider, may
not create a <i>place</i>, and, like that--<i>fill it with
himself</i>?</p>
<p>The bill directs, That the inhabitants mall chuse a number of
guardians by ballot, who shall erect a workhouse, on
Birmingham-heath--a spot as airy as the scheme; conduct a
manufacture, and the poor; dispose of the present workhouse; seize
and confine idle or disorderly persons, and keep them to labour,
till they have reimbursed the parish all expences.</p>
<p>But it may be asked, Whether spending 15,000<i>l</i>. is likely
to reduce the levies?</p>
<p>Whether we shall be laughed at, for throwing by a building, the
last wing of which cost a thousand pounds, after using it only
three years?</p>
<p>Our commerce is carried on by reciprocal obligation. Every
overseer has his friends, whom he cannot refuse to serve; nay, whom
he may even wish to serve, if that service costs him nothing:
hence, that over-grown monster so justly complains of, <i>The
Weekly Tickets</i>; it follows, whether <i>sixty</i> guardians are
not likely to have more friends to serve, than six overseers?</p>
<p>Whether the trades of the town, by a considerable manufacture
established at the workhouse, will not be deprived of their most
useful hands?</p>
<p>Whether it is not a maxim of the wisest men who have filled the
office, "to endeavour to keep the poor <i>out</i> of the house, for
if they are admitted, they become more chargeable; nor will they
leave it without clothing?"</p>
<p>A workhouse is a kind of prison, and a dreadful one to those of
tender feelings--Whether the health of an individual, the ideas of
rectitude, or the natural right of our species, would not be
infringed by a cruel imprisonment.</p>
<p>If a man has followed an occupation forty years, and necessity
sends him to the parish, whether is it preferable to teach him a
new trade, or suffer him to earn what he can at his old? If we
decide for the latter, whether he had better walk four hundred
yards to business, or four miles? His own infirmity will determine
this question.</p>
<p>If a young widow be left with two children, shall she pay a girl
six-pence a week to tend them, while she earns five shillings at
the mops, and is allowed two by the parish, or shall all three
reside in the house, at the weekly expence of six, and she be
employed in nursing them? If we again declare for the latter, it
follows, that the parish will not only have four shillings a week,
but the community may gain half a crown by her labour.</p>
<p>Whether the morals of the children are more likely to be injured
by the shops, than the morals of half the children in town; many of
whom labour to procure levies for the workhouse?</p>
<p>Whether the morals of a child will be more corrupted in a small
shop, consisting of a few persons, or in a large one at the
workhouse, consisting of hundreds?</p>
<p>Whether the grand shop at Birmingham-heath, or at any heath,
will train girls for service, preferable to others?</p>
<p>Shall we, because the house has been crowded a few weeks, throw
away 15000<i>l</i>. followed by a train of evils? A few months ago,
I saw in it a large number of vacant beds. Besides, at a small
expence, and without impeding the circulation of air, conveniency
may be made for one hundred more.</p>
<p>Did a manufacture ever prosper under a multitude of inspectors,
not one of which is to taste the least benefit?</p>
<p>As public business, which admits no profit, such as vestry
assemblies, commissions of lamps, turnpike meetings, &amp;c. are
thinly attended, even in town; what reason is there to expect a
board two miles in the country?</p>
<p>The workhouse may be deemed <i>The Nursery of Birmingham</i>, in
which she deposits her infants, for future service: the unfortunate
and the idle, till they can be set upon their own basis; and the
decrepid, during the few remaining sands in their glass. If we
therefore carry the workhouse to a distance, whether we shall not
interrupt that necessary intercourse which ought to subsist between
a mother and her offspring? As sudden sickness, indications of
child-birth, &amp;c. require immediate assistance, a life in
extreme danger may chance to be lost by the length of the road.</p>
<p>If we keep the disorderly till they have reimbursed the parish,
whether we do not acquire an inheritance for life?</p>
<p>We censure the officer who pursues a phantom at the expence of
others; we praise him who <i>teaches the poor to live</i>.</p>
<p>All the evils complained of, may be removed by <i>attention in
the man</i>; the remedy is not in an act. He therefore accuses his
own want of application, in soliciting government to <i>do</i> what
he might do himself--Expences are saved by private acts of
oeconomy, not by public Acts of Parliament.</p>
<p>It has long been said, <i>think</i> and <i>act</i>; but as our
internal legislators chuse to reverse the maxim by fitting up an
expensive shop; then seeking a trade to bring in, perhaps they may
place over the grand entrance, <i>act</i> and <i>think</i>.</p>
<p>One remark should never be lost sight of, <i>The more we tax the
inhabitants, the sooner they leave us, and carry off the
trades</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="THE_CAMP."></a>THE CAMP.</h2>
<br>
<p>I have already remarked, <i>a spirit of bravery is part of the
British character</i>. The perpetual contests for power, among the
Britons, the many roads formed by the Romans, to convey their
military force, the prodigious number of camps, moats, and broken
castles, left us by the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, our common
ancestors, indicate <i>a martial temper</i>. The names of those
heroic sovereigns, Edward the Third, and Henry the Fifth, who
brought their people to the fields of conquest, descend to
posterity with the highest applause, though they brought their
kingdom to the brink of ruin; while those quiet princes, Henry the
Seventh, and James the First, who cultivated the arts of peace, are
but little esteemed, though under their sceptre, England
experienced the greatest improvement.--The man who dare face an
enemy, is the most likely to gain a friend. A nation versed in
arms, stands the fairest chance to protect its property, and secure
its peace: war itself may be hurtful, the knowledge of it
useful.</p>
<p>In Mitchly-park, three miles west of Birmingham, in the parish
of Edgbaston, is <i>The Camp</i>; which might be ascribed to the
Romans, lying within two or three stones cast of their
Ikenield-street, where it divides the counties of Warwick and
Worcester, but is too extensive for that people, being about thirty
acres: I know none of their camps more than four, some much less;
it must, therefore, have been the work of those pilfering vermin
the Danes, better acquainted with other peoples property than their
own; who first swarmed on the shores, then over-ran the interior
parts of the kingdom, and, in two hundred years, devoured the
whole.</p>
<p>No part of this fortification is wholly obliterated, though, in
many places, it is nearly levelled by modern cultivation, that
dreadful enemy to the antiquary. Pieces of armour are frequently
ploughed up, particularly parts of the sword and the battle-axe,
instruments much used by those destructive sons of the raven.</p>
<p>The platform is quadrangular, every side nearly four hundred
yards; the center is about six acres, surrounded by three ditches,
each about eight yards over, at unequal distances; though upon a
descent, it is amply furnished with water. An undertaking of such
immense labour, could not have been designed for temporary use.</p>
<p>The propriety of the spot, and the rage of the day for
fortification, seem to have induced the Middlemores, lords of the
place for many centuries, and celebrated for riches, but in the
beginning of this work, for poverty, to erect a park, and a lodge;
nothing of either exist, but the names.</p>

<h2><a name="MORTIMER's_BANK."></a>MORTIMER's BANK.</h2>
<br>
<p>The traveller who undertakes an extensive journey, cannot chuse
his road, or his weather: sometimes the prospect brightens, with a
serene sky, a smooth path, and a smiling sun; all within and
without him is chearful.</p>
<p>Anon he is assailed by the tempests, stumbles over the ridges,
is bemired in the hollows, the sun hides his face, and his own is
sorrowful--this is the lot of the historian; he has no choice of
subject, merry or mournful, he must submit to the changes which
offer; delighted with the prosperous tale, depressed with the
gloomy.</p>
<p>I am told, this work has often drawn a smile from the reader; it
has often drawn a sigh from me. A celebrated painter fell in love
with the picture he drew; I have wept at mine--Such is the chapter
of the Lords, and the Workhouse. We are not always proof against a
melancholy or a tender sentiment.</p>
<p>Having pursued our several stages, with various fortune, through
fifty chapters, at the close of this last tragic scene, emotion and
the journey cease together.</p>
<p>Upon King's-wood, five miles from Birmingham, and two hundred
yards east of the Alcester-road, runs a bank for near a mile in
length, unless obliterated by the new inclosure; for I saw it
complete in 1775. This was raised by the famous Roger Mortimer,
Earl of March, about 1324, to inclose a wood, from whence the place
derives its name.</p>
<p>Then that feeble monarch, Edward the Second, governed the
kingdom; the amorous Isabella, his wife, governed the king, and the
gallant Mortimer governed the queen.</p>
<p>The parishes of King's-norton, Solihull, Yardley, uniting in
this wood, and enjoying a right of commons, the inhabitants
conceived themselves injured by the inclosure, assembled in a body,
threw down the fence, and murdered the Earl's bailiff.</p>
<p>Mortimer, in revenge, procured a special writ from the Court of
Common Pleas, and caused the matter to be tried at Bromsgrove,
where the affrighted inhabitants, over-awed with power, durst not
appear in their own vindication. The Earl, therefore, recovered a
verdict, and the enormous sum of 300<i>l</i>. damage. A sum nearly
equal, at that time, to the fee-simple of the three parishes.</p>
<p>The confusion of the times, and the poverty of the people,
protracted payment, till the unhappy Mortimer, overpowered by his
enemies, was seized as a criminal in Nottingham-castle; and,
without being heard, executed at Tyburn, in 1328.</p>
<p>The distressed inhabitants of our three parishes humbly
petitioned the crown, for a reduction of the fine; when Edward the
Third was pleased to remit about 260<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>We can assign no reason for this imprudent step of inclosing the
wood, unless the Earl intended to procure a grant of the manor,
then in the crown, for his family. But what he could not accomplish
by family, was accomplished by fortune; for George the Third, King
of Great Britain, is lord of the manor of King's-norton, and a
descendant from the house of Mortimer.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
